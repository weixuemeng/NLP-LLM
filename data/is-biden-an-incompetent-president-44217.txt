Discussion Name:
Is Biden an incompetent president?

1. Thesis:
Biden is an incompetent president.

  1.1. Con:
  Biden has decades of political experience.

    1.1.1. Con:
    Politicians with political experience can still behave in corrupt [1] and, thus, incompetent ways.

    1.1.2. Con:
    At least 15 US senators [2] excluding Biden were president, yet they were still capable of being incompetent.

    1.1.3. Pro:
    He served as a United States Senator from 1973 [3] to 2009.

      1.1.3.1. Pro:
      If he is a senator that was not voted out of office, it means he did things the people liked. Therefore, he will probably do things people like as president.

      1.1.3.2. Pro:
      He oversaw the confirmation of Ruth Bader Ginsburg as the second woman in the history of the Supreme Court in 1993.

      1.1.3.3. Pro:
      Biden helped ensure that important legislation was passed [4] during the Obama tenure post-2008. Legislature passed includes the 2010 Tax Relief Act, the Budget Control Act of 2011, which dealt with a debt ceiling crisis, and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.

      1.1.3.4. Pro:
      Biden sponsored [5] one of the first climate change bills in the Senate in 1986 and went on to propose curbing greenhouse gas emissions in 2007.

      1.1.3.5. Pro:
      As a Senator, Biden helped launch a “Cancer Moonshot [6]” initiative in 2016 to accelerate efforts to prevent, diagnose and treat cancer.

      1.1.3.6. Con:
      As a senator, he voted for [7] a bill outlawing gay marriage.

        1.1.3.6.1. Con:
        Biden's opinions have grown and evolved over time [8]. Now, he supports gay marriage and the rights of the LGBTQ+ community.

          1.1.3.6.1.1. Pro:
          After becoming President, Biden has taken steps that benefit the LGBTQ+ community [9]. This shows that, now, he supports this group.

      1.1.3.7. Con:
      He got nothing done as a senator, except for things that were detrimental [10] to the black community.

        1.1.3.7.1. Con:
        As a senator, Biden sponsored hundreds of pieces of legislation [11], 144 of which passed at least one chamber, 29 of which passed both chambers, and 28 of which became law.

    1.1.4. Pro:
    Biden served as the Vice President of the United States [12] for 2 consecutive terms.

  1.2. Con:
  Biden does not approve of violent attacks, such as the pro-Trump protest on the Capitol [13].

    1.2.1. Con:
    Yet he condones BLM [14] and Atifa riots, which are violent and a threat [15] to society.

      1.2.1.1. Con:
      Joe Biden condemned violence by the BLM [16].

    1.2.2. Con:
    Biden may have disapproved of the insurgence because those involved were pro-Trump. Thus, it cannot be asserted that his condemnation stemmed from his ant-violence sentiments.

    1.2.3. Pro:
    Biden's administration has already compiled [17] a comprehensive strategy proven to curb violent gun crimes.

  1.3. Con:
  He publicly fights racial discrimination.

    1.3.1. Con:
    He doesn't "fight racial discrimination," as he was openly friends [18] with KKK recruiter, Robert Byrd.

      1.3.1.1. Con:
      While Byrd was a former member of the KKK, he began changing his views [19] around 1994 and endorsed Obama [20], earning high praise from him and the NAACP. By the time Biden and Byrd were pictured together, [21] Byrd was a far cry from the white supremacist he once was.

    1.3.2. Pro:
    As President, Biden has had the most diverse cabinet [22] in US history.

    1.3.3. Pro:
    He supports the Black Lives Matter movement [23].

      1.3.3.1. Con:
      In supporting movements like BLM, he promotes the discrimination of white people.

    1.3.4. Con:
    He has spoken words in public that indicates he is racist [24].

      1.3.4.1. Pro:
      Joe Biden has the most racist [25] quotes [26] on record of any politician, or president.

    1.3.5. Con:
    Biden's words and actions suggest his stance against racial discrimination is insincere and only presented for the sake of maintaining his reputation.

      1.3.5.1. Con:
      There is no way of ascertaining what Biden's intentions are while fighting against racial discrimination. The only way we can judge his intentions is through his actions. If it appears that he believes in the fight against racial injustice, it is more likely than not that he genuinely does.

      1.3.5.2. Con:
      If Biden is actually is fighting racial discrimination, it doesn't really matter that he's doing it because of public opinion.

  1.4. Con:
  Biden has handled the COVID-19 pandemic effectively.

    1.4.1. Pro:
    Covid numbers show Biden's quick action is bringing infection rates down [27] fast.

      1.4.1.1. Con:
      The number of COVID-19 deaths could be exaggerated because, in some areas, people who die with COVID-19 are counted as people who died because of COVID-19 [28]. The rates going down could be a result of media bias in favor of Biden [29], in order to make him look good.

    1.4.2. Con:
    In a speech about COVID-19, he said that getting the vaccine was "not about freedom" [30], and that is the complete opposite of what america is about.

    1.4.3. Con:
    US public opinion about how well Biden has handled the pandemic varies along partisan lines [31], with more favorable opinions coming from Liberals.

    1.4.4. Pro:
    Biden has made Covid-19 home testing kits easily accessible and affordable [32] for all Americans.

  1.5. Con:
  Biden has a stronger relationship and better credibility with international allies than many preceding US presidents.

    1.5.1. Pro:
    Der Spiegel reworked a cover showing Trump decapitating the Statue of Liberty into one where Biden rebuilds it [33]. This attitude is common amongst many countries.

    1.5.2. Pro:
    A survey of 16 countries found that favorability of the US increased from 34% to 62% [34] and faith in the president to do the right thing rose from 17% to 75% [35] as a result of Biden taking office.

      1.5.2.1. Con:
      Joe Biden’s overall approval rating is 47%. His approval rating of the handling of the evacuation of Afghanistan is at 25% [36], and 27% approval of Biden’s handling of the border crisis [37].

        1.5.2.1.1. Pro:
        A 47% approval rating is still quite high by the standards of modern day partisan politics.

          1.5.2.1.1.1. Pro:
          Donald Trump [38] did not have approval ratings that high for pratically the whole of his presidency, and spent a large proportion of it with an approval rating more than 5% worse (a 10% margin).

          1.5.2.1.1.2. Pro:
          Only two Presidents in recorded American history did not have approval rating that at some point dipped to 47% [39].

    1.5.3. Con:
    Its hard to determine what decisions were made by Biden and what were made by those around him.

  1.6. Pro:
  Biden has been inconsistent with his stance on key issues and policies throughout his career.

    1.6.1. Pro:
    In the first several months of his presidency, Biden has backpedaled on many promises he made during his campaign.

      1.6.1.1. Pro:
      Biden has continued construction of the wall.

        1.6.1.1.1. Con:
        Practically all of the remaining construction is work to either: build flood defences, repair existing walls, protect against environmental damage or fulfill the terms of existing contracts. These expenditures could all be seen as reasonable and not outside the scope of the intention of Biden's promises.

          1.6.1.1.1.1. Pro:
          Officals from Homeland Security stated [40] - “Construction under the prior administration blew large holes into the Rio Grande Valley’s flood barrier system ... DHS will start work to quickly repair the flood barrier system to protect border communities. This work will not involve expanding the border barrier.”

        1.6.1.1.2. Con:
        Spending on the wall has been been massively reduced and diverted to other projects. This should be viewed as a partial completion of his pledges.

      1.6.1.2. Con:
      Biden kept his word in many ways in relation to handling Covid-19.

        1.6.1.2.1. Pro:
        He fulfilled [41] his promise to increase Covid-19 testing.

        1.6.1.2.2. Pro:
        Biden met his promise for 100 million jabs in 100 days and did so in just 58 days [42].

        1.6.1.2.3. Pro:
        He gave businesses [43] a restart package as promised.

      1.6.1.3. Con:
      As promised, Biden created a bipartisan commission to consider reforms to the Supreme court.

      1.6.1.4. Con:
      Biden fulfilled his promise [44] to help local governments prevent budget shortfalls.

        1.6.1.4.1. Pro:
        The American Rescue plan includes $350 billion to help alleviate this issue.

      1.6.1.5. Con:
      Biden has reversed family separation policies as promised.

      1.6.1.6. Con:
      Biden promised to reverse [45] the transgender military ban and has done so.

      1.6.1.7. Con:
      Overpromise and underdeliver is an addage that applies to practically all politicians, Joe Biden is no worse in this regard.

        1.6.1.7.1. Pro:
        Making big promises, even if they are likely undeliverable, is core part of persuading voters to vote for you.

        1.6.1.7.2. Con:
        Donald Trump did everything he said he would do, excluding what the Democrats stopped him from doing.

          1.6.1.7.2.1. Pro:
          Trump began construction of the wall [46] dividing the US and Mexico.

            1.6.1.7.2.1.1. Con:
            Trump promised to build a wall along the entire 2000 mile border, but by late 2020 had only managed to build 15 miles of new fencing [47], a dismal failure to keep his original promise.

          1.6.1.7.2.2. Pro:
          Trump oversaw a peace treaty [48] in the Middle East.

            1.6.1.7.2.2.1. Con:
            The Middle East isn't exactly a peaceful place as of this moment.

              1.6.1.7.2.2.1.1. Con:
              That is because the middle east knows Biden won't do anything about them attacking. While Trump was president, they didn't dare attack because they knew he would retaliate.

            1.6.1.7.2.2.2. Con:
            Trump's promises were of a much wider scale that an agreement between Israel, Bahrain, and the UAE. Its disingenuous to claim he got even close to delivering a fraction of his promises here.

              1.6.1.7.2.2.2.1. Pro:
              The deal between Israel and two other Middle Eastern states wasn't even a thing Donald Trump promised.

              1.6.1.7.2.2.2.2. Pro:
              Trump didn't 'do the impossible' [49] as he said he would do and manage to create peace in the Middle East.

          1.6.1.7.2.3. Con:
          Trump failed to get the Mexicans to pay for the border wall

          1.6.1.7.2.4. Con:
          Trump failed to meet his promise to bring US troops home.

          1.6.1.7.2.5. Con:
          Trump failed to resolve the trade war with China like he promised he would

          1.6.1.7.2.6. Con:
          He failed to deliver a "total and complete" ban on Muslims

          1.6.1.7.2.7. Con:
          Trump promised to clear the country's then-$19tn national debt "over a period of eight years". A promise he couldn't have been further from delivering.

          1.6.1.7.2.8. Con:
          Mr Trump repeatedly told his supporters that every single undocumented immigrant - of which there are estimated to be more than 11.3 million - "have to go". This promise never materialised.

          1.6.1.7.2.9. Con:
          The country's infrastructure "will become, by the way, second to none, and we will put millions of our people back to work as we rebuild it". Yet practically nothing was delivered.

          1.6.1.7.2.10. Con:
          Trump repeatedly questioned the military alliance's purpose, calling it "obsolete". Yet remained a member of the organisation.

          1.6.1.7.2.11. Con:
          Mr Trump said he would approve waterboarding "immediately" and "make it also much worse", adding "torture works". Yet he later rescinded that promise.

          1.6.1.7.2.12. Con:
          Trump promised to prosecute Hillary Clinton, with the common chant "Lock her up" as one of the main rallying cries of Mr Trump's supporters. He failed to do so.

          1.6.1.7.2.13. Con:
          A large volume of Trump's promises were broken, not due to polictical opposition, but because he simply promised the impossible. A quintessential example of "Overpromising".

            1.6.1.7.2.13.1. Pro:
            -> See 1.6.1.7.2.2.2.2.

      1.6.1.8. Con:
      Biden has very narrow margins in both chambers of Congress, which hamstrings his ability to fulfill his promises and ultimately means that is not really his fault.

        1.6.1.8.1. Pro:
        Biden has an effective 3 vote majority [50] in the House, and 0 vote margin [51] in the Senate.

        1.6.1.8.2. Pro:
        Many pieces of legislation require a voting supermajority to progress, or are significantly slowed down without a voting supermajority.

      1.6.1.9. Con:
      Biden hasn't even been office for a full term yet (the majority of which has been spent dealing with the immediate needs of a National Health Emergency) so it is premature to judge him on this criteria.

      1.6.1.10. Con:
      Biden upheld his promise to end the US's involvement in the Afghanistan war.

        1.6.1.10.1. Pro:
        In Afghanistan US troops have been ordered to withdraw and are no longer fighting, effectively ending America's longest war [52] as promised.

          1.6.1.10.1.1. Con:
          Biden's decision to withdraw American troops has enabled the Taliban to gain control [53] over (many regions of) Afghanistan. This will have far-reaching effects both within and beyond Afghan borders.

            1.6.1.10.1.1.1. Con:
            There is strong evidence to suggest that no resolution to the problem of Afghanistan would have been great, and staying would have only to served to delay the Taliban takeover.

              1.6.1.10.1.1.1.1. Pro:
              If the US and its allies haven't come to a solution in the 20 years since the war started, then its doubtful they ever would have managed.

              1.6.1.10.1.1.1.2. Pro:
              Within and without the country, a delay in the takeover of a few months/years isn't particularly significant.

              1.6.1.10.1.1.1.3. Pro:
              The war in Afghanistan has many costs to the US - human, monetarily, and political.

        1.6.1.10.2. Pro:
        The last US troops [54] were evacuated from Afghanistan in August 2020 on Biden's command.

        1.6.1.10.3. Con:
        Biden ordering US troops to withdraw from Afghanistan resulted in the Taliban [55] taking control of key regions of the country. This cannot be considered a testament to his competence.

      1.6.1.11. Con:
      Biden has upheld many promises that involve uniting with and maintaining relationships with other nations for global benefit.

        1.6.1.11.1. Pro:
        Biden met his promise [56] to resume ties with the Palestinian Authority.

        1.6.1.11.2. Pro:
        Biden met his promise to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement.

        1.6.1.11.3. Pro:
        Biden has rejoined the World Health Organisation as he had promised.

    1.6.2. Pro:
    Biden has changed [57] his stance on China's rise in global power after becoming president.

    1.6.3. Pro:
    After being a historically loyal supporter [58] of the Hyde Amendment, Biden reversed his stance.

    1.6.4. Pro:
    Biden and his administration has been inconsistent [59] with border migration policies.

    1.6.5. Con:
    Inconsistency is not necessarily indicative of incompetence. Instead, changing one's mind on key issues and policies could be indicative of open-mindedness, willingness to learn, and ideological flexibility, all of which are positive traits in a leader.

  1.7. Pro:
  Biden lacks leadership skills.

    1.7.1. Pro:
    He is a poor public speaker.

      1.7.1.1. Pro:
      He tried to stop a lot of the civil rights [60] movement and still says racist things

        1.7.1.1.1. Con:
        Biden counts many civil rights leaders [61] among his allies in and out of Congress.

          1.7.1.1.1.1. Con:
          Biden was also friends with many prominent segregationists. [62]

            1.7.1.1.1.1.1. Pro:
            -> See 1.3.1.

        1.7.1.1.2. Pro:
        Biden claimed that 'If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black' [63].

        1.7.1.1.3. Pro:
        He called black people "predators [64]" and that he didn't "care why they've become a sociopath [65]"

          1.7.1.1.3.1. Con:
          These statements were made during a speech in 1993. A lot of time has passed since then. It is unclear if Biden still holds such opinions.

          1.7.1.1.3.2. Con:
          Hilary Clinton had used the term "superpredator", not Joe Biden. The only time Biden has used this term was in a hearing when he said that most of the youth weren't "superpredators" [66].

      1.7.1.2. Pro:
      He often forgets [67] what he is saying throughout his speeches.

      1.7.1.3. Con:
      Joe Biden has a stutter [68], which is to blame for his gaffes.

        1.7.1.3.1. Con:
        It is unlikely [69] joe biden even has a stutter, let alone it being to blame for his gaffes.

      1.7.1.4. Pro:
      Biden has made inappropriate comments in public.

        1.7.1.4.1. Pro:
        He claimed his sister was the "love of his life" [70].

        1.7.1.4.2. Pro:
        He talked about his leg hair [71] during a campaign speech.

        1.7.1.4.3. Pro:
        He says rude things to people in the military.

          1.7.1.4.3.1. Pro:
          Biden called military members "stupid bastards [72]", "slow", and "dull".

          1.7.1.4.3.2. Con:
          Being rude to someone doesn't mean that you're incompetent.

    1.7.2. Con:
    Biden is well-educated, a quality that is beneficial for leadership.

      1.7.2.1. Pro:
      He graduated and received his BA and law degree from University of Delaware and Syracuse University.

        1.7.2.1.1. Con:
        Joe biden exaggerated [73] his school record.

        1.7.2.1.2. Pro:
        People who spend 4 years in college are probably smarter than those who don't attend college.

          1.7.2.1.2.1. Con:
          4 years in college does not [74] make you smarter, research shows.

            1.7.2.1.2.1.1. Con:
            The website says that college does [75] make you smarter.

        1.7.2.1.3. Con:
        A study [76] showed that going to college doesn't necessarily make a lot of people smarter. Hence, just because Biden went to college doesn't mean he isn't incompetent.

          1.7.2.1.3.1. Con:
          This part of the argument isn't solely based on the fact that he went to four years of "just" college. He also received a law degree.

      1.7.2.2. Con:
      Many US presidents are well-educated [77] but displayed incompetent behavior during their term.

        1.7.2.2.1. Pro:
        Donald Trump graduated from an ivy league [78] business school and yet is ranked the 2nd [79] most incompetent president.

    1.7.3. Pro:
    Unlike a leader, Biden has behaved inappropriately towards the public.

      1.7.3.1. Pro:
      He has a history of losing his temper when challenged or under pressure.

        1.7.3.1.1. Pro:
        In an interview, he told the reporter he "probably had a much higher IQ than him [80] [the reporter]."

        1.7.3.1.2. Pro:
        He yelled at a citizen, challenging the citizen to an IQ test [81].

          1.7.3.1.2.1. Con:
          Biden challenged the citizen to an IQ test because the voter accused him of being too old to run for President [82]. Biden wasn't trying to prove that he's smarter than most people, but that he has the ability to be a competent President.

        1.7.3.1.3. Con:
        This is not exclusive to Biden; many US presidents [83] have a history of losing their temper.

        1.7.3.1.4. Pro:
        The IQ of a normal person shouldn't have any bearing on their skills or consideration to be the president.

    1.7.4. Pro:
    Good leaders are able to energize [84] their audience. Biden earned the nickname of 'Sleepy Joe [85]' for his seemingly lack of energy.

    1.7.5. Con:
    Biden shows empathy [86] for the American citizens, an important leadership quality that fosters connection.

  1.8. Pro:
  Biden and his administration have been failing consistently with defense issues.

    1.8.1. Pro:
    Biden failed [87] to create a strong government in Afghanistan therefore making a strong Taliban take over easy.

      1.8.1.1. Pro:
      Once US military presence fell below 2,500 on Biden's command, the Afghanistan government began to decline [88].

      1.8.1.2. Con:
      Biden stated that former President Trump 'emboldened' [89]Taliban troops, essentially weakening any hopes of strengthening a government while encouraging the rebel group.

  1.9. Pro:
  Biden's policies are harmful to the American people.

    1.9.1. Pro:
    Biden's policies are communist [90] in nature, which is problematic for the US.

      1.9.1.1. Con:
      Communism involves public ownership of the means of production. None of Biden's proposed policies involve that. [91] Biden is typically categorized as a moderate Democrat.

        1.9.1.1.1. Pro:
        Joe Biden does not support a socioeconomic order structured upon the ideas of common ownership of the means of production or the abolition of social classes, money, and the state. Therefore by definition, he is not a communist [92].

          1.9.1.1.1.1. Con:
          Joe Biden has already enacted many socialist policies [93].

            1.9.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
            Claiming that 'plans to increase to the US budget from $6 trillion to $8 trillion per year is proof that the US is becoming a 'socialist' state' are exactly indicative of the incorrect definition used by this segment of society.

              1.9.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro:
              A 30% rise in spending, while significant, does not constitute a socialist takeover.

              1.9.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro:
              The funds come from taxes on Private Individuals and Private Companies - neither of which exist in a socialist society.

              1.9.1.1.1.1.1.3. Pro:
              The idea that spending at $6 trillion per year is good capitalism, but at $8 trillion per year it is socialism - fundamentally does make any sense.

      1.9.1.2. Con:
      As of February 11, almost a month since Biden's inauguration, there is no sign of America becoming communist. Thus, if Biden's policies are "communist" they must not be very effective at accomplishing this.

        1.9.1.2.1. Con:
        Biden and the Left are pushing their socialist agenda [94], and communism always follows socialism.

          1.9.1.2.1.1. Con:
          Fox News uses the same incorrect definition of socialism that Donald Trump uses.

            1.9.1.2.1.1.1. Pro:
            Biden will not actually make America a communist country. Trump tends to use the word "communist" incorrectly.

              1.9.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro:
              By Trump's definition, the top ten [95] countries on the happiness index would all be considered Communist.

              1.9.1.2.1.1.1.2. Pro:
              -> See 1.9.1.1.1.

              1.9.1.2.1.1.1.3. Pro:
              Trump has asserted that free and universal heathcare is a communist policy or part of the path to a communist state. In reality it is common place across the globe [96], in many countries that are evidently not communist societies.

                1.9.1.2.1.1.1.3.1. Con:
                Multiple socialist countries have universal healthcare, finland, canada, russia (clearly communist), and iceland, for example. Most of these places were socialist, yes, but according to lenin, one very large socialist influence, socialism is the first step to communism.

                  1.9.1.2.1.1.1.3.1.1. Con:
                  Canada [97], Finland and iceland [98] are all mixed market economices that are far from socialist

              1.9.1.2.1.1.1.4. Pro:
              Kamala Harris herself is clearly not a communist [99]. The idea that she would therefore turn America communist seems a little bit far fetched.

              1.9.1.2.1.1.1.5. Pro:
              Trump and many Conservative outlets use "communist" as a meaningless and self inconsistent buzzword, designed as a sort of bogeyman [100]. That definition does not in any way match the technical correct definition of the word [101].

                1.9.1.2.1.1.1.5.1. Pro:
                -> See 1.9.1.2.1.1.1.1.

                1.9.1.2.1.1.1.5.2. Pro:
                This definition allows them to illogically connect unconnected ideas and concepts together. For example "my opponent is a clearly a communist and we all know how bad things were in Soviet Russia were", where neither are remotely connected to each other.

                1.9.1.2.1.1.1.5.3. Pro:
                Communist/Communism is not the only word this group of people are willing to horribly misdefine.

                  1.9.1.2.1.1.1.5.3.1. Pro:
                  Fox News have taken the established idea of Neo-Maoism [102], and fabricated another meaningless word from it.

                1.9.1.2.1.1.1.5.4. Pro:
                These uses are usually in the form of an associative ad hominem attack, an argument style that is commonly viewed fallacious, weak and/or dishonest. Not something you want in a reliable source.

                1.9.1.2.1.1.1.5.5. Con:
                This claim fails to elaborate on what conservatives supposedly mean by communist.

                  1.9.1.2.1.1.1.5.5.1. Con:
                  Its nature as a self inconsistent buzzword means that the Conservatives do have a single consistent meaning for the word. That forms a fundamental part of this tactic.

                    1.9.1.2.1.1.1.5.5.1.1. Pro:
                    Something this undefined is innately harder to critique and analyse.

                    1.9.1.2.1.1.1.5.5.1.2. Pro:
                    If someone uses an definition different from the typical one, then the burden should fall on them to clarify what they actually mean.

                      1.9.1.2.1.1.1.5.5.1.2.1. Con:
                      But no one used communist in a different way.

                1.9.1.2.1.1.1.5.6. Pro:
                "In black-hole anti-communism everything that is perceived as threatening can be compressed into a single, treasonous, diabolical enemy." [103] This threat is entirely imagined.

          1.9.1.2.1.2. Con:
          Proto-communist states practically all increase security and police spending not "defund" them, which runs counter to the confused narrative Fox News are trying to assert.

            1.9.1.2.1.2.1. Pro:
            Police and security spending in the USSR massively outstripped growth [104].

            1.9.1.2.1.2.2. Con:
            Fox news doesn't push a confusing narrative, rather, the left does. The left pushes communism and gun control, yet also calls for defunding police. They also claim that racism is horribly wrong, and then demonizes whites and encourages racial separation.

          1.9.1.2.1.3. Con:
          -> See 1.9.1.2.1.1.1.5.3.1.

      1.9.1.3. Pro:
      Joe Biden has some questionable policies [105] regarding China.

        1.9.1.3.1. Pro:
        His executive order [106] for US to transition to electric cars will make the country more depend on China when relations are already strained.

        1.9.1.3.2. Pro:
        Biden has banned [107] US investments into Chinese owned military or surveillance technology companies, thus increasing the strain on relations.

      1.9.1.4. Con:
      -> See 1.9.1.2.1.1.1.

      1.9.1.5. Con:
      -> See 1.9.1.2.1.1.1.5.

      1.9.1.6. Pro:
      Biden supports mandating critical race theory in schools, an idea that is Marxist in nature.

    1.9.2. Pro:
    Biden's foreign policy is likely to be detrimental to American interests.

      1.9.2.1. Pro:
      His administration has shown little to no indication that they are going to withdraw from Iraq [108] despite Trump's attempts to end the war.

      1.9.2.2. Pro:
      Biden criticized Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria. It is possible that he might not withdraw [109] them in the future.

        1.9.2.2.1. Pro:
        Biden authorized airstrikes in Syria [110] to warn Iran that backing militia groups in the region will have consequences. This shows that Biden intends on using Syria as grounds to further US interests.

      1.9.2.3. Pro:
      The bombing of Syria without any justification [111], 36 days into his presidency, may indicate that he is also willing to continue the war-centered politics.

      1.9.2.4. Pro:
      -> See 1.6.1.10.1.1.

      1.9.2.5. Pro:
      According to a former US defense secretary Robert Gates [112], "Biden has been wrong on almost every U.S. foreign policy and national security issue of the last 40 years."

    1.9.3. Con:
    Joe Biden's policies are largely centrist in nature, and thus receive criticisms from groups at opposite ends of the political spectrum. While many people feel 'harmed' by his policies - they would undoubtedly feel more harmed if a politician with diametrically opposed policies, further away from their own positions, was in power.

      1.9.3.1. Pro:
      In this debate, Joe Biden has been accused of spending too much and too little on healthcare programs. In purely objective terms, these claims cannot both be true.

        1.9.3.1.1. Con:
        On the contrary, they can. Depending on your point of view, any healthcare policy could be too much, but on the opposite end, only a little is not enough.

      1.9.3.2. Pro:
      In this debate Joe Biden has been criticized for spending too much [113] and implementing too many policies related to climate change, and also for doing too little [114] to tackle climate change.

      1.9.3.3. Pro:
      Individuals have wildly different subjective truths about the right level of a policy. A sensible compromise will naturally draw criticism from people on both sides.

      1.9.3.4. Pro:
      Joe Biden has been critiqued for keeping troops in Afghanistan too long, and also failing to maintain troops to prevent the Taliban takeover. Fulfilling both simultaneously is simply not possible.

        1.9.3.4.1. Pro:
        -> See 1.6.1.10.1.1.

        1.9.3.4.2. Con:
        Joe Biden was undeniably misinformed and wrong [115] about the inevitability of the Taliban taking over Afghanistan following the withdrawal of American troops.

        1.9.3.4.3. Con:
        Presidents must seek to do what is right, not what appeals to popular opinion, even if the two options are incompatible.

      1.9.3.5. Pro:
      The addage "A good compromise is when both parties are dissatisfied" [116] matches this.

    1.9.4. Con:
    Many of the policies Biden has implemented are making positive improvements for the US.

      1.9.4.1. Pro:
      He has implemented many effective policies, such as lowering child poverty by 41% [117].

    1.9.5. Pro:
    Biden's policies are harmful to the US economy, thus harming its people.

      1.9.5.1. Pro:
      Biden was only recently inaugurated, and is already spending $4 trillion, for both the Paris accord [118] and vaccine distribution [119]. This trend will send America into poverty.

        1.9.5.1.1. Con:
        The first $2 trillion is a proposed plan spread over 4 years to combat climate change and is likely create a substantial number of jobs [120].

        1.9.5.1.2. Con:
        The 2nd $2 Trillion ($1.9 Trillion, to be precise) is proposed legislation, to be approved by the legislature, and covers a wide array of much needed Covid-19 relief [121].

      1.9.5.2. Pro:
      He relies on tax money to help solve problems which could likely cause debt [122] (and which goes into trillions)

      1.9.5.3. Pro:
      Biden's policies are likely to be detrimental to businesses because he is a Democrat [123] and many of his supporters are socialists.

        1.9.5.3.1. Con:
        Labelling a policy "socialist" does not intrinsically make it bad. Many publically owned insitutitions and industries show clear benefit to society.

          1.9.5.3.1.1. Pro:
          As an example, the UK's National Health Service is a hugely successful organisation, supported in principle by 89% [124] of the UK's population.

          1.9.5.3.1.2. Pro:
          Social Security, the Minimum Wage, maximum hour and child labor laws [125] - to name but a few of many - are all widely supported "socialist" interventions in the US.

            1.9.5.3.1.2.1. Con:
            When socialists fight for maximum hour and child labor laws, it's usually to increase the time that people work and how many children work.

        1.9.5.3.2. Con:
        He is very rich, indicating good business sense [126].

        1.9.5.3.3. Pro:
        During the Covid-19 pandemic, many small business owners expressed concern [127] for how excessive restrictions demanded by a Democratic administration were financially harming their livelihood

    1.9.6. Pro:
    Biden's policies regarding benefits to US citizens are harmful.

      1.9.6.1. Pro:
      Biden is reluctant to start the Medicare for All [128] project and the health issue will grow worse.

        1.9.6.1.1. Con:
        The Medicare for All act will not help [129] because it is bad for the economy and lowers healthcare quality.

        1.9.6.1.2. Con:
        The Democrat party does not have nearly enough support for medicare for all anyway.

          1.9.6.1.2.1. Pro:
          The Democrats have a slim majority [130], and many of which in the party are centrist. Passing something like Medicare for all would be practically impossible.

        1.9.6.1.3. Pro:
        The Covid-19 pandemic made it apparent that health care accessibility is gravely imbalanced [131], and still Biden remains resistant to implementing Medicare for All.

      1.9.6.2. Pro:
      Biden has pushed [132] for spending cuts to social security measures for decades, and is likely to do the same now.

        1.9.6.2.1. Con:
        Biden plans to expand social security [133].

        1.9.6.2.2. Pro:
        Biden's staff choices have predominantly included people known to push for economic austerity [134].

        1.9.6.2.3. Pro:
        Biden has threatened [135] to veto Medicare for All legislation on the grounds that it is too expensive.

        1.9.6.2.4. Pro:
        In 2020, Biden did not push for an increase in the stimulus amount given to low-income earners as paycheck even though he had a legitimate opportunity [136] to do so.

    1.9.7. Pro:
    Biden is unlikely to push for policies that are required to fight climate change [137] and its negative impacts on people.

      1.9.7.1. Con:
      Biden has actually nominated Jennifer Granholm for Energy Secretary [138], who defended Biden's push for a clean energy transition during her confirmation hearing.

      1.9.7.2. Con:
      On his first day in office, he re-entered the U.S [139] into the Paris Agreement [140].

        1.9.7.2.1. Con:
        The only thing the paris agreement does for america is waste [141] money.

        1.9.7.2.2. Con:
        The paris agreement hasn't worked, other countries don't hold up their end of the agreement [142].

"Expanding community distribution of free at-home tests through neighborhood sites such as health centers and rural clinics: To ensure equitable access to free at-home tests for our uninsured and underserved communities, the President will double the commitment from September to distribute 25 million free tests to community sites to 50 million tests and will add rural clinics to the program. Partnerships with trusted community providers will aid in getting these important testing supplies into the homes of our hardest-hit communities."

"China is positioning itself to lead the world in renewable energy. While Trump is attacking our friends, China is pressing its advantage all over the world," Biden added. "So you bet I'm worried about China — if we keep following Trump's path." That was a stark contrast from what Biden said in early May, where he downplayed China's strength and dismissed the rising global power as not something to be concerned about."
