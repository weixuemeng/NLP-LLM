Discussion Name:
Was Trump a good president?

1. Thesis:
Trump was a good president.

  1.1. Con:
  Trump's approach to public relations was problematic.

    1.1.1. Con:
    Trump was straightforward and open in his communication.

      1.1.1.1. Con:
      Trump's language was full of ambiguity and double speak, even pro Trump allies regularly disagreed about the true meaning of Trump's statements.

      1.1.1.2. Con:
      Trumps social media rants were largely verified lies or instances of him taking credit for achievements to which he contributed little or nothing.

      1.1.1.3. Con:
      Trump contradicted himself regularly, which is incompatible with being "straight forward".

      1.1.1.4. Pro:
      Trump was present on social media.

        1.1.1.4.1. Con:
        Fixating on social media is something that should be handled by staff. A good president would strategically always have something better to do than to read twitter, much less retweet white supremacist memes and block detractors.

        1.1.1.4.2. Con:
        Irrelevant. Social Media presence doesn't make one a good President.

          1.1.1.4.2.1. Con:
          Social media allows citizens to easily connect with their president.

            1.1.1.4.2.1.1. Con:
            Social media grants leaders unprecedented ability to sow confusion and outrage and disseminate misinformation and outright propaganda.

        1.1.1.4.3. Pro:
        Trump reports on a daily basis on social media.

        1.1.1.4.4. Con:
        His actions on/through one such social medium violated the 1st Amendment [1].

        1.1.1.4.5. Con:
        That isn't a positive thing. A large number of his social media interactions have been negative towards those he perceives as his enemies, not positive statements meant to unite us.

      1.1.1.5. Pro:
      Trump's style, while considered brash and abrasive to some, is refreshingly straightforward and to-the-point to supporters who are tired of the political establishment's double-speak and non-answers. (source [2], source [3])

    1.1.2. Pro:
    Trump and his administration emitted an unceasing flood of lies, prevarications and misleading statements [4] that was entirely without precedent. Good presidents do not lie like that.

      1.1.2.1. Pro:
      Trump is a liar; more than 70% [5] of his claims were untrue.

        1.1.2.1.1. Pro:
        Some Trump supporters liked that he was a liar and said he was "playing the media", sticking it to the left or otherwise trolling the United States from its highest office. It is not uncommon among people who want to see the US Federal government fail.

        1.1.2.1.2. Pro:
        While the exact assessments may vary, every [6] fact [7] checking [8] organization [9] established that Trump had a pattern of ignoring facts and repeating lies. While most politicians back away when caught in a lie, Trump just kept saying the same things.

          1.1.2.1.2.1. Pro:
          It may seem mediabiasfactcheck.com [10] is a fact checking site that's generally supportive of Trump, but they rarely if ever fact checked his claims. The only "facts" they appeared to evaluate were media bias (which is arguably not fact but opinion), and sometimes quoted Trump without commentary. Technically these are truthful, but consistently avoid assessing Trump's truth telling.

    1.1.3. Con:
    Trump did a good job in communication with North Korea.

      1.1.3.1. Con:
      Trump escalated the conflict with North Korea with his war of words [11].

        1.1.3.1.1. Pro:
        Trump's rhetoric and off the cuff tweets [12] in no way helped with diplomacy concerning North Korea.

          1.1.3.1.1.1. Pro:
          Going to war with North Korea would likely involve the lives of US civilians.

        1.1.3.1.2. Pro:
        North Korea did not halt its nuclear weapons program [13].

        1.1.3.1.3. Pro:
        Trump signalled he might start a nuclear war [14], ignoring and undermining the long established policy of expecting only "mutually assured destruction" from such a war. This is possibly the greatest material threat to the US and to the world.

          1.1.3.1.3.1. Con:
          The idea of "Mutually Assured Destruction" as a deterrent only works if the other side has confidence that we will respond to a threat with overwhelming force.

          1.1.3.1.3.2. Con:
          Policy is not law. Thus, Trump broke no law.

        1.1.3.1.4. Pro:
        Experts advanced the Doomsday Clock [15] 30 seconds, following Trump's inauguration. In light of the situation Trump is exacerbating with North Korea, it's likely to advance again, indicating that we are dangerously close to nuclear war.

          1.1.3.1.4.1. Con:
          The Doomsday Clock is controlled by a left-leaning ideological group that does not explain or quantify how the clock's position is set. It is currently a political statement and nothing more.

            1.1.3.1.4.1.1. Pro:
            The group behind the Doomsday Clock's decisions [16] is primarily career academic scientists (statistically left-leaning [17]), balanced by a few people who are active in Democrat policymaking and a former governor of California (also a Democrat). There are only 3 or 4 exceptions in the group of 19.

            1.1.3.1.4.1.2. Pro:
            The Doomsday Clock averages about 2 minutes closer to midnight during Republican presidencies [18] than during Democrat presidencies, and has tended to move closer to midnight when a Republican president is elected and away when a Democrat president is elected.

          1.1.3.1.4.2. Con:
          The Doomsday Clock is absurd. According to the clock, we have been closer [19] to nuclear war since the end of the Cold War in the 1990s than during the Cold War's hottest phase in the 1960s and episodes like the Cuban Missile Crisis [20].

      1.1.3.2. Pro:
      The United States of America is the most powerful nation in the world (source [21]). Trump's supporters are very happy (source [22]) to see a leader that is not timid and conciliatory when faced with a weak but historically aggressive country that uses abusive rhetoric to garner support for its failing industry (source [23]).

    1.1.4. Pro:
    Trump's speaking abilities, statements and behavior indicated that he was ill-educated and unintelligent.

      1.1.4.1. Pro:
      Almost everything he said or wrote had to be interpreted and paraphrased by his staff, close family or political party, and whom he usually contradicted shortly after.

      1.1.4.2. Con:
      Trump spoke in a way that was easily understandable by the average American voter.

    1.1.5. Pro:
    Trump had no filter and said anything that came to his head.

      1.1.5.1. Con:
      Trump had access to daily classified executive briefings on all topics. If he had no filter, he would have compromised state secrets. He did not.

    1.1.6. Con:
    Trump and his family received unprecedented attacks from the Democrats and the press. His accomplishments in office are impressive and they occurred in the face of a barrage of personal attacks [24].

      1.1.6.1. Con:
      The study goes on to say that this does not necessarily reflect media bias or unfairness [25] as the research did not evaluate whether the criticisms were legitimate or not.

      1.1.6.2. Con:
      Trump was in a unique public facing position as he was previously a reality TV star, and as such members of the public were used to commenting on him.

      1.1.6.3. Pro:
      A rational judgment of President Trump is not possible until his negative media coverage, much of it false, is fully understood.

        1.1.6.3.1. Pro:
        The Mainstream media (MSM) including ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, MSNBC, Time magazine, the highly influential newspapers in New York, Washington, Los Angeles, and Boston and most other large daily newspapers are strongly biased toward the left. Their news is mostly talking points of the Democrat Party.

        1.1.6.3.2. Pro:
        MSM and Democrats used black and white thinking, emotionally charged labels and slogans, generalizations and oversimplifications, opinions disguised as facts, selective reporting, half-truths and lies/hoaxes to constantly support Democrat positions and unfairly smear President Trump.

    1.1.7. Pro:
    Trump personally insulted and intimidated people.

      1.1.7.1. Pro:
      Trump relied on personal insults against his opponents, interrupted them at debates, and even attempted to physically intimidate some by looming behind them [26].

      1.1.7.2. Pro:
      Trump's forcing people out, or belittling them, led to an increasing lack of trust from the GOP, hurting the ability of the administration to get anything done.

  1.2. Pro:
  Considering that he has had almost no Democrat support since he took office, his performance could not have been better.

    1.2.1. Con:
    It would be unusual for a Republican president to enjoy Democrat support, so this fact does not distinguish Trump from other presidents as being particularly strong.

    1.2.2. Con:
    Half of Trump's term was with a Republican house and senate.

  1.3. Pro:
  Trump was a good president in terms of foreign affairs.

    1.3.1. Pro:
    Trump made more NATO members pay their fair share [27] (when he took office only 3 of 30 countries were paying their fair share).

    1.3.2. Con:
    The Trump administration's immigration policies were unjustified and discriminatory.

      1.3.2.1. Pro:
      Trump called for a "complete and total shutdown on Muslims entering [28] the United States" for a period. This would be religious discrimination.

        1.3.2.1.1. Con:
        It also could just be a safety concern.

          1.3.2.1.1.1. Pro:
          Trump justified the ban on Muslims entering the US to give the US time to assess the terror threat [29] posed by Muslims coming out of countries afflicted with terrorism.

          1.3.2.1.1.2. Con:
          Whether the intention behind banning Muslims was good, the effect was still religious discrimination.

          1.3.2.1.1.3. Con:
          Concern regarding the terror threat posed by Muslims arriving from the targeted countries was not evidentially supported [30]. As such, it was not a legitimate concern.

      1.3.2.2. Pro:
      Trump's policies in relation to the US-Mexico border were problematic.

        1.3.2.2.1. Pro:
        Trump's administration separated children from their parents [31] at the border.

          1.3.2.2.1.1. Con:
          When adults break the law in America, their children don't go to prison with them. Many adults crossing the border are illegal immigrants and thus breaking the law.

        1.3.2.2.2. Pro:
        Trump proposed that Mexico could be persuaded to pay for the wall, by threatening to use the Patriot Act [32] to bar illegal aliens from sending money to their families across the border. This would be authoritarian and unethical.

        1.3.2.2.3. Pro:
        The well documented family separations by ICE [33] are certainly violent and specifically due to Trump's policies (via Sessions).

    1.3.3. Pro:
    Trump effectively navigated complex trade relations and secured strong trade deals for the US.

      1.3.3.1. Pro:
      Trump attacked the opioid crisis with initiatives, legislation, and making it part of the China trade negotiations.

    1.3.4. Pro:
    The Trump administration helped build peace and security in the Middle East.

      1.3.4.1. Pro:
      Trump secured a permanent ceasefire in Northeast Syria.

        1.3.4.1.1. Con:
        The permanent ceasefire appeared to be a politically self-interested move to remove US sanctions on Turkey at the expense of Kurdish-led forces [34] and the war crimes being committed against them by Turkey.

      1.3.4.2. Pro:
      In August 2020, the Trump administration secured the first agreement to normalize relations between Israel and a major Arab country (UAE) in decades.

      1.3.4.3. Con:
      Relocating the US embassy to Jerusalem can be seen as undermining the Arab-Israeli peace process [35], particularly between Israelis and Palestinians.

        1.3.4.3.1. Con:
        Trump rightly recognized Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Israel by relocating the US embassy [36] there.

          1.3.4.3.1.1. Pro:
          Presidents Clinton, Bush, and Obama all campaigned on doing this but didn’t follow through.

      1.3.4.4. Con:
      Trump reneged on the Iran deal [37] for no real reason. This could have eroded our ability to be trusted in the future by adversaries or rivals.

        1.3.4.4.1. Con:
        The Iran nuclear deal was widely and vehemently disliked [38] by Conservatives and by many allies of the USA.

          1.3.4.4.1.1. Pro:
          Under Barack Obama, card-carrying officials of the Muslim Brotherhood, such as Mohamed Elibiary [39], were acting as officials of the U.S. Government. This undermined trust in the Iran deal.

          1.3.4.4.1.2. Pro:
          It is unacceptable to allow a nuclear weapon into the hands of a nation whose eschatology believes it is their personal role to instigate the end of times.

          1.3.4.4.1.3. Con:
          The USA's allies most vehemently opposed to the Iran deal - such as Saudi Arabia [40] and Israel [41] - have their own feuds with Iran so may not be impartial commentators of the benefits of the deal for the USA.

      1.3.4.5. Con:
      Trump said that in the Iraq war, the US should have taken Iraq's oil [42]. This would constitute a war crime.

        1.3.4.5.1. Con:
        Suggesting a course of events that would have constituted a crime is not itself criminal.

      1.3.4.6. Con:
      Trump's actions in Syria did not solve the crisis [43].

    1.3.5. Con:
    Trump pulled out of the US Iran nuclear deal leading Iran to restart their nuclear weapons program [44].

    1.3.6. Con:
    Trump decimated the state department staff [45] to the point where they could no longer function and instead spent more on unnecessary military might.

      1.3.6.1. Con:
      Sec State Tillerson [46] was the one directly responsible for the dire staffing issues in his State Department.

        1.3.6.1.1. Con:
        The State Department's staffing issues reflect on Trump because he appointed Tillerson and kept him there, without providing him with much apparent guidance.

      1.3.6.2. Con:
      Defense spending is necessary for an economy of research and development [47]. Entitlement spending, which is what Obama focused on, is not [48].

    1.3.7. Con:
    Trump pushed the USA out of the Paris Agreement [49].

      1.3.7.1. Con:
      The Paris Agreement is an unnecessary expenditure of money and control of US interests by foreign powers.

        1.3.7.1.1. Con:
        The Paris Agreement [50] does not demand anything of anyone; it is just mutual agreement trying to protect the planet.

          1.3.7.1.1.1. Con:
          There’re no meaningful repercussions for violations/violators.

        1.3.7.1.2. Con:
        The lack of real and symbolic commitment to minimize the damage of global climate change is an insult to the countries we need to cooperate with, and to the many who will unnecessarily die from climate driven weather effects, conflicts or simple exposure where they might not have, otherwise.

        1.3.7.1.3. Pro:
        The Paris Agreement could cost the US $2.5 trillion [51] in aggregate GDP by 2035.

      1.3.7.2. Con:
      Leaving the Paris Agreement was a campaign promise [52] that Trump delivered on [53] with overwhelming support from Republicans. Leaving the Agreement is an argument in favor of Trump's effectiveness as a president, not against. (source [54]).

        1.3.7.2.1. Pro:
        Republicans overwhelmingly voted against the H.R.9 Climate Action Now Act which attempted to discourage pulling out of the Paris Climate Agreement. Of 197 Republican votes, 190 were against [55] and 4 abstained.

    1.3.8. Con:
    -> See 1.1.3.1.

    1.3.9. Con:
    Trump alienated US allies and eroded our position on the global stage.

      1.3.9.1. Pro:
      -> See 1.3.4.4.

      1.3.9.2. Pro:
      Trump's claim that Mexico would pay for his wall led to friction with Mexico [56].

      1.3.9.3. Pro:
      Trump blustered to the UN that America pays the most and isn't getting a good deal, claiming the UN is ineffective at accomplishing its goals.

        1.3.9.3.1. Con:
        It was factual. The United States of America is the largest donor [57] to the United Nations.

      1.3.9.4. Pro:
      Trump blasted NATO allies, claiming that they weren't paying enough [58] for protection.

        1.3.9.4.1. Con:
        Trump was successful with these complaints: several NATO allies of the US increased [59] their defense spending in response.

          1.3.9.4.1.1. Pro:
          With an eye on the problematic state of the armed forces in countries like Germany [60], this is a positive outcome and, in the long run, in the interest of the US as well as its allies.

      1.3.9.5. Pro:
      Trump directly insulted and slighted German Chancellor Angela Merkel [61], who later remarked that the US can no longer be relied upon.

        1.3.9.5.1. Pro:
        Trump refused to shake Merkel's hand [62].

          1.3.9.5.1.1. Con:
          Trump's spokesperson explained that he didn't shake Merkel's hand because he did not hear her [63] say they should shake hands.

        1.3.9.5.2. Con:
        Merkel is senior enough to let this minor incident not affect political relations. After all, Merkel has worked through a lot of rulers like Trump. Internationally Trump or Erdogan and domestically Horst Seehofer.

    1.3.10. Con:
    Trump was not tough on Russia.

      1.3.10.1. Con:
      Trump opted for diplomatic relations with Russia instead, which is a more effective strategy.

        1.3.10.1.1. Pro:
        Trump's strike on airbases [64] in Syria was well timed and diplomatically communicated to the Russians.

          1.3.10.1.1.1. Con:
          Despite US interference, the West lost Syria [65].

          1.3.10.1.1.2. Con:
          There is no evidence that these strikes were effective, and whether they were legal is a point of debate. Satellite images observed planes launching from the airbase [66] just hours after the attack.

          1.3.10.1.1.3. Pro:
          Syria stopped using chemical weapons blatantly after the attacks.

      1.3.10.2. Pro:
      Trump called for Russia to be re-admitted into the G7 [67] after Russia was expelled for its invasion and annexation of Crimea. He made this statement three months after the Russian nerve agent attack in England.

      1.3.10.3. Pro:
      Trump signed a bill from Congress to impose sanctions, but blasted it heavily and publicly [68], making it clear that he only did it because he had no choice.

      1.3.10.4. Pro:
      One of Trump's first moves was to try to return two compounds [69] placed under sanctions by the Obama Administration.

      1.3.10.5. Pro:
      Trump's election was rigged by Russian interference.

        1.3.10.5.1. Pro:
        All US Intelligence agencies stated that Russia interfered with the election.

          1.3.10.5.1.1. Pro:
          CIA, FBI, and NSA officials are all on record with similar statements to this effect.

        1.3.10.5.2. Con:
        The Russian influence was largely via paid advertisements. They did not change the votes, they changed the minds of the American people. Therefore, Russian influence was negligible.

          1.3.10.5.2.1. Con:
          People vote based on their thoughts and opinions. Changing someone's thoughts or opinions on political matters is effectively changing their vote.

    1.3.11. Pro:
    Trump stood up to China [70], something that Biden is adopting as his policy.

      1.3.11.1. Pro:
      Trump voiced the economic and political threats [71] posed by China throughout his presidency.

  1.4. Con:
  Trump attempted to overturn the results of the presidential election without any evidence of widespread fraud.

  1.5. Con:
  Trump was not re-elected, supporting the fact that the population did not approve of his 4 years in office. This suggests he was a bad president.

  1.6. Con:
  Trump's policies were against scientific and social progress.

    1.6.1. Con:
    Trump advocated for gender equality.

      1.6.1.1. Pro:
      In 2017, Trump signed the Women, Peace, and Security Act [72].

      1.6.1.2. Pro:
      In 2019, Trump established the Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative [73].

      1.6.1.3. Pro:
      The Trump tax cuts doubled the Child Tax Credit from $1,000 to $2,000 while expanding eligibility

      1.6.1.4. Pro:
      Trump pushed for and signed into law the largest ever expansion of the Child Care and Development Block Grants [74] to states and is the first president to include a national paid leave program in all of his annual budgets.

      1.6.1.5. Pro:
      The Trump administration used the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act [75] to prosecute websites that facilitate human trafficking.

      1.6.1.6. Pro:
      The president established a task force to help combat the tragedy of missing or murdered Native American girls [76].

      1.6.1.7. Pro:
      For the first time ever, half of the National Security Council’s [77] leadership was made up of women, with 12 of its 24 directorates being led by women.

    1.6.2. Con:
    Trump was for space-exploration [78].

      1.6.2.1. Con:
      Trump wanted us to go back to the moon, then flipped back to going Mars, which he falsely claimed included the moon [79].

      1.6.2.2. Con:
      Trump proposed a pointless "Space Force [80]" to create new problems in space.

      1.6.2.3. Con:
      Trump's focus on space exploration was part of a long-standing effort by Republicans to shift the focus of NASA away from climate change, at the behest of private corporate interests.

    1.6.3. Pro:
    Trump is a climate change denialist [81].

    1.6.4. Pro:
    Trump tried to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) [82].

    1.6.5. Pro:
    Trump slashed science funding [83].

    1.6.6. Pro:
    Trump withdrew from numerous treaties [84].

    1.6.7. Pro:
    Trump did little to improve or protect public health.

      1.6.7.1. Con:
      Trump held a mental health summit [85] to improve early detection of mental illness, provide more hospitals, and allow for easier commitment.

        1.6.7.1.1. Pro:
        Liberal author D.J. Jaffee [86] says the president and Republicans are doing more for the mentally ill than Democrats because the latter redirect the money available to other people in need.

      1.6.7.2. Con:
      President Trump signed an executive order expanding access to telehealth services to ensure rural Americans access to healthcare.

      1.6.7.3. Pro:
      Trump undermined Obamacare.

        1.6.7.3.1. Con:
        Trump was unable to fulfil his campaign promise to revoke Obamacare [87].

          1.6.7.3.1.1. Con:
          Trump and the Republican congress proudly undermined the ACA by eliminating the individual mandate, creating their own new brand of chaos in the healthcare market.Repealing Individual mandate "nibbling at the sides" of ACA and increases costs [88] Galen Institute evaluates rate increases [89] "Some states have tried to expand health insurance coverage without an individual mandate, ultimately causing chaos in their marketplaces." [90]

        1.6.7.3.2. Pro:
        The number of people covered [91] went down for the first time in years.

      1.6.7.4. Pro:
      Trump's regulation policies sought to overturn environmental protections that were important for the health and well being of Americans.

        1.6.7.4.1. Pro:
        Within his first 100 days, Trump signed a repeal of a law banning coal companies from dumping debris in local streams [92].

        1.6.7.4.2. Pro:
        Trump's EPA director, Scott Pruitt, rejected a ban on an insecticide [93] known to pose a risk to fetal brain and nervous system development.

        1.6.7.4.3. Pro:
        Trump ordered a "review" and elimination of the water protections [94] afforded by the Clean Water Act [95].

        1.6.7.4.4. Pro:
        The Trump administration rolled back regulation on power plants dumping toxic metals [96] such as arsenic, lead, and mercury into public waterways.

        1.6.7.4.5. Pro:
        The Trump administration ceased limiting methane and toxic pollutant emission [97] at new oil and gas drilling sites.

        1.6.7.4.6. Pro:
        Trump signed an executive order ceasing the implementation of the Clean Power Plan [98].

        1.6.7.4.7. Con:
        Trump's push against regulation was a response to over-regulation during the Obama era (source [99]).

        1.6.7.4.8. Con:
        President Trump's efforts to overturn regulations were a campaign promise that Trump very effectively delivered on (source [100]).

          1.6.7.4.8.1. Pro:
          In a free, democratic state, it is more important for a US president to deliver on their promises than paternalistically usurp the will of the people.

      1.6.7.5. Con:
      Trump forced hospitals to disclose their pricing [101] to consumers.

      1.6.7.6. Pro:
      Trump's handling of the COVID pandemic was woefully insufficient and led to a large death toll as a result.

        1.6.7.6.1. Con:
        The heavy impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the US tracks back to the institutionalized problems within its health care system [102]. These preceded Trump's presidency.

          1.6.7.6.1.1. Pro:
          Because health coverage in the US is attached to employment [103], an economic recession or pandemic can lead to millions losing access to health care.

        1.6.7.6.2. Con:
        He helped with healthcare, launching a Operation Warp Speed [104]. Before that, it took a very long time to create a vaccination, while this program took 9 months to create one. It helped many more lives than killing them.

    1.6.8. Con:
    Pushed for, and signed into law, sweeping prison reforms backed by leaders of the African-American community.

    1.6.9. Con:
    Created the White House Hispanic Prosperity Initiative to improve educational and economic opportunities for Hispanic Americans.

  1.7. Pro:
  Trump's economic policies were successful.

    1.7.1. Pro:
    The Trump administration invested $6.3 billion [105] in rural electric infrastructure.

    1.7.2. Pro:
    The Trump administration awarded many grants to Americans in need.

      1.7.2.1. Pro:
      The administration awarded $24 million in grants to expand education options for American Indian and Alaska native students.

    1.7.3. Pro:
    Trump slashed regulations on the economy leading to economic growth.

      1.7.3.1. Con:
      Some regulations are necessary to protect citizens. The regulations slashed seemed to help corporations make a profit instead of protecting the American people in the long run.

      1.7.3.2. Con:
      Economic growth is a long-term process. Growth that was reported in 2017 is at least as attributable to policies of the previous administration as it is attributable to the current administration's policies.

      1.7.3.3. Con:
      While slashing regulation can be expected to promote growth in the short term, the long term results of deregulation may not be positive.

      1.7.3.4. Con:
      The economy was already growing [106] when he started, and some of his off-the-cuff statements even caused significant downward shifts in the stock market [107]. It would be difficult to prove or even provide worthwhile anecdotes that deregulation is responsible for our continued growth.

      1.7.3.5. Pro:
      Trump vowed not to let ‘misguided’ environmental regulations get in the way of American economic interests [108]. The result was that many blue collar jobs in the energy industry were protected and created - partially as a result of the expansion in fracking.

        1.7.3.5.1. Con:
        Fracking has numerous harmful effects [109]. These harmful effects could have been reduced by regulation. Thus, Trump's reduction of regulation led to an increase in the harmful effects of fracking.

        1.7.3.5.2. Con:
        Blue collar jobs in the energy industry would be better protected by implementing training programs to help workers transition into jobs in renewable energy production.

      1.7.3.6. Con:
      Trump backed the GOP budget plan, which moved forward. That along with the proposed tax plan increased deficit spending drastically, ultimately leading to trillions being added to the federal debt [110]. Even taking into account any economic growth created by the plan, most economists still calculated huge shortfalls.

    1.7.4. Con:
    Trump's budget was discussed by many people after its release, and relied on a fantasy of incredible non-stop growth [111] to make up for its own spending.

    1.7.5. Con:
    Trump's economic policies were strongly biased towards the top 1%, leaving the majority of Americans to suffer, such as his tax plan, [112] and his proposed federal budget [113].

      1.7.5.1. Con:
      The tax plan was predicted (by the Trump administration) to increase economic growth and "trickle down" [114] to the common man.

      1.7.5.2. Con:
      Proposed tax rates under Trump were more progressive than those under Ronald Reagan or Abraham Lincoln, who were both considered good presidents.

        1.7.5.2.1. Pro:
        The top tax rate in the 2017 GOP bill was 39.6% [115]. By comparison, the top tax rate under Reagan fell to 28% [116], and during Lincoln's presidency, it was 7.5% [117] before being repealed entirely.

    1.7.6. Con:
    Trump's call to increase military spending [118] when the USA already spent substantially more than other countries on it added to deficit.

    1.7.7. Pro:
    The creation of Opportunity Zones (OZs), with tax incentives for investment helped provide new housing, businesses, and jobs, the positive effects of which are being seen in deprived cities such as Birmingham, AL and Erie, PA. [119]

      1.7.7.1. Con:
      Opportunity zones seem to mostly be a good way for the wealthy to avoid taxes while providing limited benefits to struggling communities according to this article [120] in the times.

    1.7.8. Con:
    Trump's Affordable Care Act (ACA) executive order [121] increased expenses for both the American taxpayer and the American government itself.

    1.7.9. Con:
    Trump's presidency saw a rise in unemployment [122], suggesting his economic approach was unsuccessful.

    1.7.10. Con:
    Trump's denial of the severity of the Coronavirus [123] led to more damage being done to the economy than was necessary.

  1.8. Con:
  Trump stoked division and violence.

    1.8.1. Pro:
    Many incidents of harassment and attacks [124] were attributed to Trump.

      1.8.1.1. Pro:
      Trump's support of Nazis and white supremacists led to a massive spike in domestic hate crimes [125] and mass shootings.

        1.8.1.1.1. Con:
        Trump, in fact, condemned [126] white supremacists.

          1.8.1.1.1.1. Con:
          Trump was hesitant to condemn white supremacists, doing so only after facing significant public pressure.

          1.8.1.1.1.2. Con:
          Trump's condemnation amounted to little more than lip service when white supremacists continued to perceive him as being on their side and supporting their interests.

          1.8.1.1.1.3. Pro:
          In 2020, the Trump re-election campaign released a video compilation of 38 times Donald Trump clearly and explicitly condemned white supremacy [127].

        1.8.1.1.2. Con:
        There’s a difference between causation and correlation.

        1.8.1.1.3. Pro:
        Trump described white-nationalist protesters as "very fine people" [128].

          1.8.1.1.3.1. Con:
          Trump’s words were taken out of context regarding the white supremacists, and others in the crowd in Carolina; not everyone at the protest in Charlottesville were neo-Nazi's and white supremacists.

        1.8.1.1.4. Pro:
        Trump's preoccupation with Obama's birth certificate [129] and his need to undermine everything Obama achieved can be interpreted as racist.

          1.8.1.1.4.1. Pro:
          Trump never asked about the birth certificates of any other US presidents. He only asked about Obama, and more recently, Kamala Harris [130], who is also not white.

      1.8.1.2. Pro:
      Trump encouraged violent responses against unsupportive audience members at his rallies [131], and implied that he'd be happy to see Hillary Clinton shot [132] by second amendment supporters. This set a tone that was maintained throughout the campaign and beyond.

    1.8.2. Pro:
    Trump targeted the LGBTQ+ community, notably transgender people, which may have encouraged their ill treatment in society.

      1.8.2.1. Con:
      Trump openly supported the LGBTQ+ community [133] before Obama and Biden. Evidence can be found in their interviews and press meeting.

      1.8.2.2. Pro:
      Trump prohibited transgender people [134] from joining the military.

        1.8.2.2.1. Con:
        There’s concern the transgender folks will negatively impact unit cohesion [135].

          1.8.2.2.1.1. Pro:
          Unit cohesion is critical in combat especially when lives are on the line.

          1.8.2.2.1.2. Con:
          Concern about the negative impact on unit cohesion is unfounded [136]. (p. 4)

            1.8.2.2.1.2.1. Con:
            Reports often make assumptions and are frequently biased.

              1.8.2.2.1.2.1.1. Pro:
              Humans are biased.

        1.8.2.2.2. Con:
        Some transgender people seek gender reassignment surgery at tax payer expense [137].

          1.8.2.2.2.1. Con:
          Even on a high estimate, the cost to the military (and by extension the taxpayer) to cover transgender-related medical care would be $8.4 million/year, representing a 0.1% increase [138] to the military health care budget.

            1.8.2.2.2.1.1. Con:
            The military already has lots of other expenses.

            1.8.2.2.2.1.2. Pro:
            The military wastes lots of money on unnecessary things.

              1.8.2.2.2.1.2.1. Con:
              If the military has a problem wasting money on unnecessary things, then wasting more money on more unnecessary things will not solve the problem.

        1.8.2.2.3. Con:
        Reassignment surgery is an unnecessary additional expense.

          1.8.2.2.3.1. Con:
          Given how fundamentally important it is to some transgender people's identity, self-esteem, and mental health, reassignment surgery is not a luxury but a necessity.

            1.8.2.2.3.1.1. Con:
            Measurements and surveys based on how people reportedly feel, aren’t always scientifically reliable [139].

              1.8.2.2.3.1.1.1. Pro:
              When we don’t know which surveys are reliable, therefore, that impacts the reliability of all of them.

      1.8.2.3. Con:
      Trump reinstated long standing regulations [140] regarding gay and transgendered individuals serving in US armed forces that were reversed only during the Obama administration.

    1.8.3. Pro:
    -> See 1.3.2.2.3.

    1.8.4. Con:
    Trump didn’t stoke division and violence amongst the Democrats, he purely exposed what was already there.

    1.8.5. Con:
    The media was responsible for stoking division and violence by deliberately portraying Trump's statements out of context [141] and catastrophizing the implications.

  1.9. Pro:
  Trump made positive institutional changes.

    1.9.1. Con:
    Even though Republicans dominate the US' political landscape, not much progress is going on.

      1.9.1.1. Pro:
      -> See 1.6.7.3.1.

      1.9.1.2. Pro:
      Trump has been frustrated by his inability to fulfill many of his campaign promises.

        1.9.1.2.1. Con:
        He is frustrated by this because he seems to not understand the fact that all the things he wants to do have to go through multiple groups of people before his plan goes into action. Most of the time, the other groups of people don't agree with him.

      1.9.1.3. Pro:
      A lack of any major legislative accomplishments is below average for a president at this point.  For example, at this point in Obama’s presidency he managed to pass and sign the Stimulus package which saved the US economy and auto industry.

    1.9.2. Con:
    Trump gutted [142] the US bureaucracy.

    1.9.3. Con:
    Trump nominated extreme partisan judges [143].

    1.9.4. Con:
    Trump ignored subpoenas [144], setting a bad precedent for checks and balances

    1.9.5. Con:
    Any positive institutional changes were not a result of Trump's policies themselves, but as a retaliation against his actions.

      1.9.5.1. Con:
      Like other presidents, Trump was a vocal critic of Congress. Yet because of his leadership style, Congress regained ground in the political turf war against the presidency.

        1.9.5.1.1. Con:
        Congress took no material steps towards reducing the power of the presidency.

        1.9.5.1.2. Pro:
        -> See 1.1.7.2.

        1.9.5.1.3. Con:
        Partisanship [145] in Congress diminished its ability to hold Trump to account.

        1.9.5.1.4. Pro:
        Congress voted to impeach Trump twice [146], including some Republicans.

        1.9.5.1.5. Pro:
        Nancy Pelosi [147] - Speaker of the House and fierce critic [148] of Trump - gained political support during his presidency.

          1.9.5.1.5.1. Pro:
          At times, Nancy Pelosi's approval ratings [149] were comparable to Trump's.

          1.9.5.1.5.2. Pro:
          56% [150] of Americans supported the second impeachment of Trump, which was announced by Nancy Pelosi [151].

      1.9.5.2. Pro:
      Federal levels were increasingly eager to exercise their powers.

      1.9.5.3. Con:
      The impetus for change comes about not because the system works as intended, but because demonstrable flaws were exploited against the collective good of the democracy.

      1.9.5.4. Pro:
      Voter mobilization attempts [152] increased in 2020 as a result of the voter suppression that took hold in 2016.

    1.9.6. Con:
    Trump's leadership led to the degradation of the reputation [153] of the GOP.

      1.9.6.1. Pro:
      Many Republicans who were previously critical of Trump have either acquiesced to or actively support [154] his leadership now.

      1.9.6.2. Pro:
      Trump's leadership has led to a rise in celebrity candidates [155] within the Republican Party.

      1.9.6.3. Pro:
      Trump's leadership of the GOP has led to an increase in violent acts [156] by Republican voters.

      1.9.6.4. Con:
      The GOP remained strong and united [157] under Trump's leadership.

        1.9.6.4.1. Con:
        This strength and unity [158] comes at the expense of adherence to democratic values, which opposes the principles underlying the Republican Party.

    1.9.7. Con:
    Trump undermined and destabilized liberal democracy.

      1.9.7.1. Pro:
      Trump supported dictators, autocrats, and human rights violators.

        1.9.7.1.1. Pro:
        Trump had an affinity towards Putin [159].

        1.9.7.1.2. Pro:
        According to John Bolton, Trump praised China [160] for its treatment of its Uighur population.

        1.9.7.1.3. Con:
        He believes establishing a relationship with dictators such as Putin and Kim Jong Un is the best way to make deals good for America—the highest priority being avoiding nuclear war.

        1.9.7.1.4. Con:
        One of the most important things in deal making is establishing a relationship with the other side—a relationship that includes as a minimum some respect and trust.

      1.9.7.2. Pro:
      Trump didn't concede the 2020 election that he lost and instead propagated conspiracy theories.

        1.9.7.2.1. Con:
        Trump ultimately had a peaceful transition of power to Biden.

      1.9.7.3. Pro:
      Trump was corrupt.

        1.9.7.3.1. Pro:
        Trump colluded [161] with Russians to smear his opponents [162], created a climate of fear, and undermined people's efforts to get true coverage of the news and the campaign, using hackers [163], troll factories, and bots that shared [164] upsetting divisive rhetoric and actual fake news.

          1.9.7.3.1.1. Con:
          The sources most often cited have been assessed to be left-leaning or left, and can therefore be considered biased.

        1.9.7.3.2. Pro:
        Trump had a conflict of interest.

          1.9.7.3.2.1. Pro:
          He had extensive domestic conflicts of interest, and refused to move his own business ventures to a blind trust.

            1.9.7.3.2.1.1. Con:
            Trump wasn't prosecuted for domestic conflicts of interest, just accused.

              1.9.7.3.2.1.1.1. Con:
              There are many reasons why people aren't prosecuted for things which are unrelated to the truth of the accusations.

                1.9.7.3.2.1.1.1.1. Con:
                If we are innocent until proven guilty, accusations are just that accusation until a trial.

          1.9.7.3.2.2. Pro:
          Trump's actions violated the emoluments clause as he was personally enriched by foreign dignitaries [165] staying at his hotels, and even by the secret service paying to use the facilities at his own hotels and golf resorts.

            1.9.7.3.2.2.1. Con:
            Trump was not impeached or prosecuted [166] for violating the emoluments clause.

            1.9.7.3.2.2.2. Con:
            Violating the emoluments clause doesn't prove that he is qualitatively a good or bad president.

              1.9.7.3.2.2.2.1. Con:
              While "good" and "bad" will always be objective, a president who violates the law he has sworn to uphold can objectively be considered to be doing a poor job.

            1.9.7.3.2.2.3. Pro:
            Trump owned the resorts where he stayed so neither he nor anyone in his entourage had to pay for lodging, food & beverages, greens fees or membership fees.

          1.9.7.3.2.3. Con:
          Trump owned the properties where he stayed therefore neither he nor anyone in his entourage had to pay for lodging, food and beverage, membership fees or greens fees.

        1.9.7.3.3. Pro:
        Trump and many of his closest advisors were investigated for colluding with a foreign power to undermine the election.

          1.9.7.3.3.1. Con:
          People are still innocent until proven guilty in America.

            1.9.7.3.3.1.1. Pro:
            The "innocent until proven guilty" mantra derives from the 6th Amendment [167].

        1.9.7.3.4. Pro:
        -> See 1.3.10.5.

      1.9.7.4. Con:
      Trump's electoral success and popularity show he is both a product of and symbol for liberal democracy in action.

        1.9.7.4.1. Con:
        His election says less about Donald Trump and more about the people who voted for him.

          1.9.7.4.1.1. Pro:
          Trump’s election shows that people recognize that Donald Trump puts America first.

        1.9.7.4.2. Pro:
        Trump was almost re-elected [168] for a second term, losing by only three states (and 22,000 votes in those states). This indicates that, at the very least, Trump still had significant support at the end of his presidency.

        1.9.7.4.3. Con:
        Due to flaws in the electoral process, electoral success is a poor indicator of a president's competence or popularity.

          1.9.7.4.3.1. Pro:
          Trump did not win the popular vote [169], meaning most of the electorate did not elect him.

          1.9.7.4.3.2. Pro:
          The electoral process can and sometimes does select poor leaders, even when followed faithfully.

            1.9.7.4.3.2.1. Pro:
            The electorate is not infallible; indeed it often changes its own mind.

        1.9.7.4.4. Con:
        Trump being duly elected does not support or dissprove the claim that he is a “good president”. All presidents, regardless of being “good” or “bad” were elected.

          1.9.7.4.4.1. Con:
          The 10th president of the US (John Tyler [170]) was not elected.

            1.9.7.4.4.1.1. Con:
            John Tyler, along with the other few presidents who were sworn in after the death of a president, would be the exception, not the rule.

        1.9.7.4.5. Con:
        Trump was elected with 46.1 percent of the popular vote. Of the 5 presidents who have won from a minority, only one served a second term. The one who achieved a second term finished with a 25% approval rating at the end of his second term. This suggests presidents who lose the popular vote were not considered good presidents.

      1.9.7.5. Pro:
      Trump seeded incompetence and corruption via his questionable appointments and staff selections.

        1.9.7.5.1. Con:
        The American people benefited from the efforts of Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner who were working for no salary.

          1.9.7.5.1.1. Pro:
          Ivanka has worked tirelessly on workforce development, women’s empowerment around the world [171], and paid family leave.

          1.9.7.5.1.2. Pro:
          Jared Kushner helped restore Israeli-UAE relations [172], promoting peace in the Middle East.

          1.9.7.5.1.3. Pro:
          Kushner was the architect [173] of the criminal justice reform bill.

            1.9.7.5.1.3.1. Con:
            Trump publicly snubbed [174] Kushner's First Step Act, so he should not be credited for the Act.

          1.9.7.5.1.4. Pro:
          Kushner helped negotiate [175] the trade deal with Mexico.

          1.9.7.5.1.5. Pro:
          Kushner ran the Office of American Innovation [176] dedicated to reorientating government efforts in a variety of areas.

          1.9.7.5.1.6. Con:
          Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump were able to work for no salary as they had significant external income in their time in the White House [177].

        1.9.7.5.2. Pro:
        Trump's staff turned over at an alarming rate, causing many to describe his White House as chaotic and unhinged.

        1.9.7.5.3. Pro:
        Rick Gates is another example of Trump's incompetent or complicit failure to build a staff that will not become a subject of criminal investigations.

          1.9.7.5.3.1. Pro:
          George Papadopoulos is another example of Trump's incompetent or complicit failure to build a staff that will not become a subject of criminal investigations.

        1.9.7.5.4. Pro:
        Trump's cabinet appointments were people who wanted to manipulate those offices in order to enrich themselves and their corporations at the expense of the people.

          1.9.7.5.4.1. Con:
          Constant re-shuffling of advisors made it cumbersome for them to consolidate their power.

            1.9.7.5.4.1.1. Con:
            Trump caused his own encumbrance. He was responsible for the constant re-shuffling of advisors.

          1.9.7.5.4.2. Pro:
          Trump brought Scott Pruitt [178] to the EPA, who is known for his wasteful and self-indulgent spending.

          1.9.7.5.4.3. Pro:
          Betsy DeVos [179] - who was appointed Secretary of Education - was a private school owner, and so had a vested interest in deregulating and privatizing the school system.

          1.9.7.5.4.4. Pro:
          Scott Pruitt - who was appointed director of the EPA - had a record of suing the EPA [180] on behalf of polluting businesses.

          1.9.7.5.4.5. Pro:
          Steve Mnuchin [181] - who Trump appointed Treasury Secretary - is known as "the foreclosure king", is a bank excecutive, and so had a vested interest in removing vital consumer protections from the banking industry.

        1.9.7.5.5. Pro:
        Many of Trump's cabinet picks embodied what is known as regulatory capture [182].

          1.9.7.5.5.1. Con:
          Trump ran for office as a non-politician. Many of his cabinet picks were also not from the political world. Trump's appointees reflected the Republican public's feelings of distrust for career politicians. It was never about regulatory capture.

        1.9.7.5.6. Pro:
        Many of Trump's associates were or continue to be the subjects of criminal investigations, charges, and prosecutions.

          1.9.7.5.6.1. Pro:
          Even before becoming president, Trump's campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was arrested on charges by Special Council Robert Mueller.

          1.9.7.5.6.2. Pro:
          Michael Flynn [183] - Trump's national security adviser - pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his relationships with Russian officials twice.

        1.9.7.5.7. Con:
        Trump promised to "drain the swamp" [184]. On many metrics, he succeeded at this.

          1.9.7.5.7.1. Con:
          Perhaps Trump's most important campaign promise, to rid the government of corruption (drain the swamp), he claims to have failed, accusing his own vice president, the federal government, and friendly state governments of widespread voting corruption.

          1.9.7.5.7.2. Pro:
          During his presidency, Trump cut payroll [185] in most federal agencies.

        1.9.7.5.8. Pro:
        Trump’s staff appointments were well below the average of other presidents at the same points in their presidency (both Obama and Bush had already appointed twice as many staff at this point). An understaffed government (especially the State Dept), place the USA in greater jeopardy — the opposite result of a good president.

      1.9.7.6. Con:
      Trump directly challenged the media [186] which is an information source for many citizens.

        1.9.7.6.1. Pro:
        Trump challenged the conservative leaning Fox News [187].

        1.9.7.6.2. Con:
        Given that Trump also challenged truth in every way, his challenge to the media was not weighted with any value.

          1.9.7.6.2.1. Pro:
          Trumps' White House repeatedly released false claims - notably claiming Trump had a record turnout [188] at his inauguration.

          1.9.7.6.2.2. Pro:
          Trump popularized the term 'fake news [189]' repeatedly dubbing information he disliked false.

      1.9.7.7. Con:
      Trump motivated large groups of voters out of political apathy.

        1.9.7.7.1. Pro:
        Trump's presidency shed light on the polarization in American [190] politics which had been hidden from the public eye for years.

        1.9.7.7.2. Pro:
        Trump's presidency caused voters to reflect on their political identities [191] beyond the labels of 'Republican/Democrat'.

        1.9.7.7.3. Pro:
        More people than ever voted in the 2020 election [192] following Trump's presidency, suggesting his time in the Oval Office was motivating for voters.

        1.9.7.7.4. Con:
        The fact that Trump's poor behavior had positive by-products, does not speak to his credit.

        1.9.7.7.5. Con:
        It is questionable whether the mobilization of voters who are swayed by lies and political theater benefits democracy.

      1.9.7.8. Pro:
      Trump manipulated freedom of expression to further his own agenda.

        1.9.7.8.1. Pro:
        Trump put a gag order [193] on the department of the interior.

        1.9.7.8.2. Pro:
        Trump declared war on 'fake news', his term for anyone that criticised him or his policies. This is the hallmark of a dictator.

          1.9.7.8.2.1. Con:
          Trump tweeted that [194] he had no interest in censoring any news outlets; he was simply criticising them, something which his freedom of speech gives him a right to do.

            1.9.7.8.2.1.1. Con:
            As President, Trump's words carry weight that those of ordinary citizens do not. Therefore, while he may not call directly for censorship, his words nevertheless generate hostility to the free press among his base.

            1.9.7.8.2.1.2. Con:
            Trump did not merely criticize news outlets; he dubbed them enemies, attacked them in ad hominem fashion, and was prepared to begin investigating various journalists personally [195].

          1.9.7.8.2.2. Pro:
          He threatened to "fix" the first amendment and called freedom of the press "disgusting" and said the press was "the enemy of the people" [196].

          1.9.7.8.2.3. Pro:
          When Trump and his people spread disinformation at press conferences and interviews, and when confronted with it, they frequently become combative or dismissive rather than supporting their claims with logic or evidence (which does not exist in those situations).

          1.9.7.8.2.4. Con:
          Freedom of speech in America applies to everyone, even would be dictators.

        1.9.7.8.3. Con:
        Freedom of speech is often inconvenient.

          1.9.7.8.3.1. Pro:
          Freedom is inconvenient to anyone trying to hold power or control others, like governments naturally do.

    1.9.8. Pro:
    Trump was a great illusionist; he distracted mainstream media with his tweets while he disassembled bureaucracy.

  1.10. Con:
  Trump did not have the values, character and charisma necessary to be a good president.

    1.10.1. Pro:
    Trump did not take responsibility for or acknowledge any mistakes. Taking responsibility is an important trait in a leader of any kind.

      1.10.1.1. Con:
      He has sometimes apologized [197].

      1.10.1.2. Con:
      He apologized for saying, “grab them by the pussy” [198].

    1.10.2. Pro:
    -> See 1.1.7.

    1.10.3. Con:
    It is more important to have a CEO type leader with business experience who gets good things done for Americans, starting with security and a good economy.

"Compared to other recent presidents, news reports about President Trump have been more focused on his personality than his policy, and are more likely to carry negative assessments of his actions, according to a new study from the Pew Research Center's Journalism Project."
[25] https://text.npr.org/555092743
"While some may be tempted to read this as evidence of media bias, the leader of Pew's Journalism Project said that isn't a conclusion one can draw from the study.

"Our data show that outlets with left and more mixed audiences did cover more negatively assessed elements of Trump's early presidency, while media with right-leaning audiences covered more positively assessed," said Amy Mitchell, director of journalism research at Pew. "Whether one or all of these are in-line or out-of-line with reality is beyond the capacity of this research.""

"The ban should apply "until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on" with regard to the attitudes of Muslims toward Americans and terrorism, said a statement from the Trump campaign.

"Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life," the statement quoted Trump as saying."

"While Western leaders were insisting there was no military solution to the conflict in Syria, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s military intervention to save the crumbling Assad regime proved that was a lie. Moscow’s sponsorship of Assad has allowed him to pursue a campaign of mass aerial bombardment of civilian infrastructure, while the international community’s response has been to issue strongly worded statements about ceasefires.

After nearly a decade of civil war, Syria’s opposition is broken and fragmented. Having received no significant international support, most of Syria’s democratic military opposition groups have been disbanded or devoured by hardline Islamists."

"A substantial part of economic progress under Trump occurred before his signature economic policy took effect. President Trump’s most significant economic policy, his $1.9 trillion tax cuts, did not take effect until January 2018—a year after he took office. By that time, unemployment had dropped from 4.7 to 4.1 percent, household incomes had increased $850, and 2.3 million new jobs had been created."

"Through his philanthropic work over the years with charities combating the AIDS crisis, his previous support of amending the 1964 Civil Rights Act to include a ban on discrimination based on sexual orientation, and his early support of gay couples having the same rights and protections as straight couples, Trump was an ally long before he was president. He is likely even the first private club owner in Palm Beach, Florida, to admit an openly gay couple."

"Five years after Trump went from celebrity to the presidency, some Republicans see his path as a blueprint for winning back the Senate. This campaign cycle, the GOP is coalescing around former football star Herschel Walker’s bid to turn Georgia red in 2022. Republicans are also signaling an openness to surgeon and TV host Mehmet Oz’s Senate campaign in Pennsylvania, another battleground state."
[156] https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/03/republican-party-democracy-political-violence-trumpism
"Republicans are breaking from the principle that precedes the idea of democracy and is even more fundamental: the belief that arguments between citizens should be resolved by peaceful means. Today’s Republican party is normalising the notion of violence as a means of securing a political outcome."
[157] https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/05/donald-trump-republican-party-capitol-attack-insurrection
"In the year since the insurrection that reverberated around the world, Trump’s stranglehold on Republicans has seemingly become stronger, not weaker. Graham was soon back on the golf course with him; McCarthy was soon kissing the ring at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Many leaders of the party have set about changing the narrative of the insurrection to portray it as a heroic last stand – a new “lost cause”."
[158] https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/08/american-democracy-fighting-for-its-life-republicans
"The Republican party of 2021, and especially its leaders, have now abandoned those principles [democracy]. At a national level, they have refused to accept the legitimacy of the 2020 election results, and encouraged or condoned violence. At a state level, they have abused their power to change the rules in ways that restrict voting rights. Though these anti-democratic sentiments have been building within the ranks of the party for years, the events of 2021 mark the transformation of the Republican party into a genuinely illiberal party, and a grave threat to the continuation of American democracy as we’ve known it."

"When President Donald Trump huddled with campaign aides in the late spring to discuss his bid for reelection, White House senior adviser Jared Kushner told his father-in-law he should highlight last year’s historic passage of the First Step Act — a sweeping criminal justice reform bill that eluded previous administrations and has earned celebrity support.

Kushner reiterated the positive selling points of that bill during the Oval Office meeting as Trump campaign officials and White House aides ticked through the president’s achievements, wondering which would resonate most with his adoring base. But Trump wasn’t interested and told Kushner he didn’t think his core voters would care much about a bipartisan deal for which he’s since accused Democrats of trying to steal credit."
