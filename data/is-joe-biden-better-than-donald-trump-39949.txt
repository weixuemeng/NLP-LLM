        Factors such as foreign interreference [18] have reduced the trust people have in democratic institutions.

      1.1.3.2. Pro:

      Biden has been physically cleared [23] in his recent medical assessment.

        1.1.4.1.1. Con:
        A physical assessment is not a comprehensive examination of cognitive function. It is only one piece of the puzzle, and often comes preliminary to a number of other more pertinent tests [24] for examining cognitive and neurological function.

        1.1.4.1.2. Pro:
        If the physical (and mental, as stated in the article [25] of the parent claim) that cleared Biden were not comprehensive enough, the same could be said about Trump and any other previous president.

      1.1.5.2. Pro:

        1.1.5.2.1. Pro:
        During the 2020 Vice Presidential debate [30], Kamala Harris also failed to denounce this.

        1.1.5.2.2. Con:

    Joe Biden is not mentally fit, compared to Donald Trump, to be the president of the United States.

      1.1.7.1. Pro:
      Biden has messed up his recollections in many instances [37]. This might indicate that he is mentally unfit to run the United States.

        1.1.7.1.1. Pro:
        Joe Biden mistakenly mentioned [38] that he was a Democratic candidate for the United States Senate.

        1.1.7.1.2. Con:
        Ronald Reagan [39] was known for being forgetful, but was mentally sound while in office. There is not necessarily a correlation between being forgetful and being mentally unfit.

        1.1.7.1.3. Pro:
        Biden's actions and manner indicate that he could possibly have dementia [40].

          1.1.7.1.3.1. Pro:

      1.1.7.2. Con:
      Most of the USA public believes that Trump is less mentally fit [46] to be president than Joe Biden.

        1.1.7.2.1. Pro:
        According to a Fox News poll [47], more than half of voters, 51 percent, said Trump was not mentally fit to serve as president, but just 39 percent said Biden was mentally unfit.

        1.1.7.2.2. Con:
        This is irrelevant. Public opinion is often wrong, especially about something that cannot be known without thorough medical evaluation.

  1.2. Con:
  Joe Biden, compared to Donald Trump, is unpopular among the American people.

    1.2.1. Con:
    The public in the USA has shown at multiple points that they like Biden.

      1.2.1.1. Con:
      Biden had one of the lowest 2nd year approval ratings amongst USA presidents in history. [48]

        1.2.1.2.3. Con:
        Biden winning the election could just mean that the Democratic party was more popular than Trump's Republican party.

      1.2.1.3. Pro:
      Throughout the first year in office, Biden had a higher public approval rating [51] than Trump during his first year. If anything, Biden is therefore more popular with the American people.

    1.2.2. Con:
    Joe Biden is popular because he makes Americans feel more secure through his national security policies.

      1.2.2.1. Pro:
      Unlike Trump, Biden has not promoted the invasion and destruction of government-owned property [52].

        1.2.2.1.1. Pro:
        Trump encouraged his supporters to reverse the election and keep Trump in power by storming the Capitol. [53]

        1.2.2.1.2. Pro:
        Biden never asked his protestors to damage [54] government property.

      1.2.2.2. Con:
      Joe Biden opened up America’s stockpile to Ukraine against America’s national security interests [55]. This is likely to make the Russia-Ukraine conflict more deadly and dangerous for all parties involved.

        1.2.2.2.1. Con:
        Curbing Russian power and influence is imperative to safeguard American national security, and aiding Ukraine in defeating Russia presents a means to attain this goal.

        1.2.2.2.2. Pro:
        Russia has made multiple requests to the USA to diminish its military deployment near Russia [56] and has cautioned the US about the use of force if the US persists in its perceived threats against Russia.

    Joe Biden has alienated the left [57] in the USA.

      1.2.3.1. Pro:
      Joe Biden negotiates excessively with the right and ends up abandoning many leftist ideals.

        1.2.3.1.1. Pro:
        Joe Biden is progressive, but stays centralist so he can attract independents and centrist republicans.

          1.2.3.1.1.1. Con:
          The Democratic left does not like working with centrist liberals [58].

          1.2.3.1.1.2. Pro:
          Given how closely divided the USA population was in the 2020 elections, Biden has to come up with centrist policies [59] acceptable to both sides to get any policies passed.

        1.2.3.1.2. Con:
        Joe Biden introduced many policies [60] at the start of his term to appease leftist sections of the Democratic party.

          1.2.3.1.2.1. Pro:
          Joe Biden has increased public spending [61] and focused on public welfare to appease the Democratic left.

          1.2.3.1.2.2. Con:

      1.2.3.2. Con:
      Donald Trump, the point of comparision, alienates the far left at least as much, if not far more so than Joe Biden.

        1.2.3.2.1. Con:
        The leftist demographic never expected the Republican party to have a leftist candidate and thus did not feel alienated when Trump was selected as their Republican candidate.

        1.2.3.2.2. Pro:
        Donald Trump is staunchly against the left and has said so many times in his speeches.

      1.2.3.3. Pro:
      Joe Biden's criticism of Bernie Sanders alienated the left.

        1.2.3.3.1. Pro:
        Bernie Sanders was well liked amongst the Democratic left; Biden's criticism of him makes him come across as anti-Democratic left.

        1.2.3.3.2. Con:
        Joe Biden was competing with Sanders for the Democratic party's presidential candidacy; he had no choice but to criticize Sanders.

    1.2.4. Pro:
    Joe Biden has poor public speaking skills and is unable to inspire the American population.

      1.2.4.1. Pro:
      Joe Biden ends up mumbling because on multiple occasions he's forgotten [64] what he's speaking about.

        1.2.4.1.1. Con:
        Biden does not have poor public speaking skills; he has a speech disorder [65] that prevents him from speaking clearly.

          1.2.4.1.1.1. Con:
          A speech disorder would cause someone to have poor public speaking skills because they would prevent a person from speaking clearly.

          1.2.4.1.1.2. Con:
          Biden's speech disorder was a minor stutter that he came over [66] at a young age; his poor public speaking skills as president aren't affected by a childhood stutter.

          1.2.4.1.1.3. Pro:
          Biden had a stutter as a child [67] that probably made it difficult for him to develop communication skills in the same way as other children.

        1.2.4.1.2. Pro:
        Many pundits and journalists agree that Biden is gaffe-prone [68].

      1.2.4.2. Con:
      Trump’s public speaking skills are also poor [69]; he speaks informally and has a poor vocabulary.

        1.2.4.2.1. Pro:
        Trump deviates [70] from his pre-written speeches and often makes inflammatory comments.

        1.2.4.2.2. Con:
        Trump's way of speaking excites the crowd [71] and makes him come across as relatable and genuine.

  Joe Biden has developed better policies than Donald Trump.

    1.3.1. Pro:

      1.3.1.2. Con:
      Under Trump's presidency, in 2019, America has become energy independent [73].

        1.3.1.2.1. Con:
        Energy independence just implies that the USA produced more energy than it consumed, it was still dependent on fossil fuels [74] for this energy.

        1.3.1.2.2. Pro:
        The proportion of energy generated from coal decreased from 30% to 14% [75] from 2019 to the year when the USA achieved energy independence last time, i.e., in 1957.

    Under Trump, the USA economy improved [79] more than it did under Joe Biden.

      1.3.2.1. Con:

        1.3.3.1.1. Pro:

        1.3.3.2.1. Con:

        The current minimum wage is not enough to live on. [94]

      1.3.3.3. Pro:
      Even before becoming president, Joe Biden proposed spending nearly $4 trillion on rejoining the Paris Agreement [95] and vaccine distribution [96]. Such spending could lead America into poverty.

        1.3.3.3.1. Con:
        The cost of a policy, even if high, is not a reason against the policy.

        1.3.3.3.2. Pro:

          1.3.3.3.3.2. Con:

          The USA, according to Biden, led the world in vaccine donations, [105] delivering 110 million+ COVID-19 vaccine doses to 65 countries.

        1.3.4.1.2. Con:
        Despite working with scientific organizations, Joe Biden could not increase vaccination uptake [106] meaningfully, so his strategy was not thought out properly.

      1.3.4.2. Con:
      Joe Biden took away public rights and liberties in handling the Coronavirus.

        1.3.4.2.1. Pro:
        People's medical choices should remain private. Joe Biden is urging for door to door vaccinations [107], and requiring people to show proof of vaccination.

        1.3.4.2.2. Pro:
        Joe Biden made vaccination uptake mandatory in response to the spread of the Delta variant [108], this undermines the bodily autonomy [109] of American citizens.

            1.3.4.2.2.2.1. Con:
            Joe Biden protected the bodily autonomy of American citizens by ensuring fewer people caught the Coronavirus, which would have arguably impacted bodily autonomy more than a vaccine shot would.

          1.3.4.2.2.3. Con:
          Vaccines were only made mandatory [112] for federal, healthcare, and education workers.

        1.3.4.2.3. Con:
        Joe Biden ensured people remained alive to practice public rights and liberties by vaccinating them.

        1.3.4.2.4. Con:
        The state owes a responsibility to protect its people from all forms of threat.

          1.3.4.2.4.1. Pro:
          The state takes away certain rights during other instances where its citizens lives are at stake, such as war.

          1.3.4.2.4.2. Con:
          If people do not consent to the state’s methods to protect them, those actions are invalid.

      1.3.4.3. Pro:
      Joe Biden took the Coronavirus more seriously than Trump.

        1.3.4.3.1. Pro:
        Donald Trump has knowingly underplayed [113] the seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic.

          1.3.4.3.1.1. Pro:
          Donald Trump continued shaking hands during the pandemic [114] which showed his lack of precaution and care for the COVID-19 pandemic.

          1.3.4.3.1.2. Pro:
          Donald Trump spread a lot of misinformation [115] about the Coronavirus and the vaccines that combat it during the pandemic.

            1.3.4.3.1.2.1. Pro:
            Trump said that he took medication that would make him "immune to the virus" [116].

            1.3.4.3.1.2.2. Pro:
            A study found that Trump was the largest driver [117] of Coronavirus misinformation during the pandemic.

            1.3.4.3.1.2.3. Con:
            Trump likely tried to play down the threat of Covid to prevent mass panic which would have made tackling the pandemic tougher.

          1.3.4.3.1.3. Con:
          Despite disagreements about specific statements or actions, it is unfair to suggest that President Trump knowingly downplayed the pandemic. Like many others, he initially underestimated the severity of the virus or the speed at which it would spread.

        1.3.4.3.2. Pro:
        Joe Biden doesn't ignore CDC guidelines [118], or acts as if COVID-19 will just go away [119].

        1.3.4.3.3. Con:
        Trump was quick to impose travel restrictions [120] because he understood the threat posed by Covid-19.

        1.3.4.3.4. Con:
        The Covid vaccine was primarily developed [121] under Trump's presidency.

      1.3.4.4. Con:
      More than 156,000 people died [122] because of the Coronavirus during the first 14 weeks of Biden's presidency.

        1.3.4.4.1. Pro:
        Biden did not want to rush out the vaccine because "Trump can't be trusted". [123] Biden could possibly have endangered the lives of millions because of political point-scoring.

          1.3.4.4.1.1. Con:
          Biden was anxious that the vaccine was rushed, which could have ultimately endangered more citizens.

          1.3.4.4.1.2. Pro:
          Given that Trump spread much misinformation [124] about Covid vaccines, it was wise not to trust him.

        1.3.4.4.2. Con:
        Death rates linked to the Coronavirus sharply fell [125] during Biden’s presidency compared to Trump’s.

          1.3.4.4.2.1. Con:
          Deaths were bound to drop during Biden's presidency compared to Trump's because vaccines had been developed and proliferated by then.

          1.3.4.4.2.2. Pro:
          Biden greatly increased access [126] to vaccines for vulnerable communities.

        1.3.4.4.3. Pro:
        More people died on the 12th of February 2021 [127], under Biden's presidency, than they did on any other day because of the Covid virus.

        1.3.4.4.4. Con:
        Joe Biden faced strong resistance from Republican state governors on policies relating to the Coronavirus and vaccination which led to increased deaths.

  1.4. Pro:
  Joe Biden's extensive political experience makes him more likely to be a better president than Donald Trump.

    1.4.1. Pro:
    Joe Biden's extensive diplomatic experience is likely to make him better at foreign policy issues than Donald Trump.

      1.4.1.1. Con:
      Joe Biden has a track record of poor foreign policy decisions in addressing international terrorism threats.

        1.4.1.1.1. Pro:
        Joe Biden removed the designation [128] of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization endangering American and Israeli citizens.

        1.4.1.1.2. Pro:
        The Taliban seized control of Afghanistan [129] after President Biden withdrew American troops, believing that the Afghan government would be able to resist the Taliban.

        1.4.1.1.3. Pro:
        In 2011, Biden advised Obama against sending a team to kill Osama bin Laden [130].

      1.4.1.2. Pro:
      Trump’s aggressive personality makes him unsuitable for handling USA’s international relations.

        1.4.1.2.1. Pro:
        A survey of 16 countries found that favorability of the USA increased from 34% to 62% [131] and faith in the president to do the right thing rose from 17% to 75% [132] as a result of Biden taking office.

        1.4.1.2.2. Con:
        Joe Biden has historically supported violent and aggressive foreign policies, which have global repercussions.

          1.4.1.2.2.1. Pro:
          Joe Biden voted for the Iraq War [133] that led to over a decade of war and thousands of deaths [134]. This would imply that his judgment is not sound on such matters.

            1.4.1.2.2.1.1. Con:
            Trump also supported the Iraq war at the time [135].

            1.4.1.2.2.1.2. Con:
            He previously voted to go to war in Iraq, not currently. He regrets that decision but it was based on the intel at the time [136].

            1.4.1.2.2.1.3. Pro:
            The war in Iraq caused the American tax payer over 2 trillion dollars [137].

            1.4.1.2.2.1.4. Pro:
            Biden falsely assumed [138] that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and connections to Al-Qaeda.

          1.4.1.2.2.2. Pro:
          Joe Biden has dragged the USA into the Russia-Ukraine conflict elongating and amplifying the war's harmful impacts.

            1.4.1.2.2.2.1. Con:
            The USA promised to protect [139] Ukraine and thus had to intervene in the region when Russia started its invasion.

            1.4.1.2.2.2.2. Con:
            It is crucial for USA foreign policy to contain Russia's power [140], which requires preventing Russia from expanding its influence and control in Eastern Europe.

            1.4.1.2.2.2.3. Pro:
            Joe Biden has made Ukraine's war with Russia into America's conflict.

          1.4.1.2.2.3. Con:
          Joe Biden voted against the Gulf War [141] - a war that is considered "a well-executed, agile use of American power" by most historians.

      1.4.1.3. Con:
      Trump has successfully negotiated peace in various conflict-ridden regions across the globe.

        1.4.1.3.1. Pro:
        Donald Trump helped broker a peace deal [142] between Israel, the UAE, and Bahrain.

        1.4.1.3.2. Pro:
        Trump significantly reduced hostilities between North Korea and the USA, becoming the first American president to set foot [143] in North Korea.

          1.4.1.3.2.1. Pro:
          Trump was able to get a pledge from North Korea to denuclearize [144].

          1.4.1.3.2.2. Con:
          Insisting on a maximalist goal of denuclearization in the face of a growing and increasingly sophisticated North Korean nuclear arsenal is very unlikely to work [145].

        1.4.1.3.3. Con:
        Trump initiated a trade war with China [146] that heightened global tensions and caused massive economic damage.

      1.4.1.4. Pro:
      Trump has soured the USA’s relationship with many of its allies.

        1.4.1.4.1. Pro:
        Trump came off as rude and hostile [147] to many NATO members.

        1.4.1.4.2. Con:
        USA allies are dependent [148] on the its military support and thus cannot meaningfully break off their alliance.

        1.4.1.4.3. Pro:
        Trump's threats and rhetoric have increased tensions with international organizations and blocs [149].

    1.4.2. Con:
    Joe Biden's 40+ year career as a Senator and Vice President shows a lack of significant accomplishment.

      1.4.2.1. Con:
      Biden's experience in negotiating and passing bills highlights his ability to navigate complex legislative processes.

        1.4.2.1.1. Pro:
        Joe Biden has been able to get bipartisan support [150] to pass bills and push forward policy.

          1.4.2.1.1.1. Pro:
          Joe Biden succeeded in enacting the Affordable Care Act, despite years of opposition from the Republican party, by garnering bipartisan support [151].

          1.4.2.1.1.2. Con:
          Joe-Biden's reliance on bipartisan support means he often has a shaky stance on key issues.

        1.4.2.1.2. Con:
        Biden's poor communication skills [152] prevent him from being able to discuss or explain his policies adequately.

          1.4.2.1.2.1. Pro:
          Biden has been able to pass many popular policies without being able to take credit [153] for them because of his poor communication skills.

          1.4.2.1.2.2. Con:
          Policy making within the legislative assemblies is not as dependent on public speaking skills as it is on negotiating ability and political experience.

      1.4.2.2. Pro:
      Joe Biden has been very inconsistent [154] on his positions and policies on most major issues in the USA.

    1.4.3. Pro:
    Joe Biden has been working in government institutions for a long time.

      1.4.3.1. Con:
      The length of one's time sent in the office is not necessarily proportional to the quality of work they do there.

      1.4.3.2. Con:
      The fact that Joe Biden was a part of the Democratic party for so long without being able to make a presidential run before 2020 should be a cause of worry.

      1.4.3.3. Pro:
      Joe Biden spent many years as a senator, having been first elected in 1972 [155].

      1.4.3.4. Pro:
      Joe Biden has more experience working directly from the White House.

        1.4.3.4.1. Con:
        The President has more responsibility [156] than the Vice President. Therefore, Donald Trump's experience is more valuable than Joe Biden's.

        1.4.3.4.2. Pro:
        Joe Biden has spent 8 years [157] in the White House, compared to Donald Trump's 4.

        1.4.3.4.3. Pro:
        Given that Joe Biden has worked in the White House before, it is likely that he understands the challenge of being president better than Donald Trump.

    1.4.4. Con:
    Joe Biden is a politician from an earlier generation and is out of touch [158] with modern political needs and demands.

      1.4.4.1. Pro:
      Biden has lost a lot of young voters because he has been out of touch [159] with their needs.

      1.4.4.2. Con:
      Young voters' vital support [160] for Joe Biden and the Democrats in key Senate races during the mid-term elections can be attributed to their perception that Biden relates to their unique issues.

"News organizations, universities, nonprofits, and think tanks are vital to democratic systems, yet they are under attack as experts are discredited and organizations whose missions are to hold leaders accountable and support democratic values fall under attack. There are threats to academic freedom that make it difficult for professors to transmit knowledge to the next generation and help students learn valuable critical reasoning skills. By delegitimizing knowledge sector organizations, these attacks weaken accountability and harm system performance. The undermining of civil society makes it difficult to address basic problems such as gun safety, climate change, and income inequality."

"Federal authorities later identified Crowl, 50, as a member of a self-styled militia organization in his home state of Ohio and affiliated with the extremist group the Oath Keepers. His mother told CNN that he previously told her “they were going to overtake the government if they…tried to take Trump’s presidency from him.” She said he had become increasingly angry during the Obama administration and that she was aware of his support for former President Donald Trump."

"After last week’s rebound, Republican confidence in the 2020 election outcome ticked down again this week: 32 percent of GOP voters say the election was free and fair, down 4 percentage points from last week. The movement has also driven further distrust in general confidence in the U.S. elections system."

"The demands, spelled out by Moscow in full for the first time, were handed over to the US this week. They include a demand that Nato remove any troops or weapons deployed to countries that entered the alliance after 1997, which would include much of eastern Europe, including Poland, the former Soviet countries of Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, and the Balkan countries.

Russia has also demanded that Nato rule out further expansion, including the accession of Ukraine into the alliance, and that it does not hold drills without previous agreement from Russia in Ukraine, eastern Europe, in Caucasus countries such as Georgia or in Central Asia."

"The embrace of sweeping liberal ideas is dramatic — with about $2 trillion in coronavirus relief spending passed and another $2 trillion in infrastructure spending proposed, along with new taxes focused on wealthy individuals and companies to help pay for this and additional spending.

Those policies have been paired with steady attention from Biden’s top aides, including Chief of Staff Ron Klain, who are in frequent touch with groups that have long harbored suspicions about the president’s corporate ties and incremental instincts."

"Former vice president and now Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has consistently been portrayed as gaffe-prone. Pundits and journalists describe Biden’s speeches as filled with moments of “bumbling” and “stumbling,” triggering questions about the candidate’s mental fitness and hinting at possible age-related cognitive decline."

"As the President, or any public official for that matter, solid speaking skills that allow you to convey your message and win public support are essential. The first rule of public speaking: if people can take something the wrong way, they will. This is why the President has to have every word pre-approved and vetted by somebody who is a professional speech writer. 

Trump’s problem is when he looks up from the teleprompter, he lets his ego get the best of him, and he starts saying stupid things that are inflammatory."

". One of the major changes in fossil fuels has been in coal’s share, which dropped from 30 percent of production in 1957 to 14 percent in 2019 due to a similar drop in consumption share. Coal’s decline over those 62 years was replaced by the advent of nuclear power and an increase in natural gas and renewable energy."

How rare it is to have Israel’s two most senior ministers fighting for Arab concerns (as well as their own) by reminding Team Biden that the IRGC’s malign tentacles extend throughout the Middle East, and that they bear responsibility for attacks on American civilians and American forces in the region"

""I thought to myself, what is he talking about?" Mr Christie told the BBC. "If you're going to take a victory lap, at least have the presence of mind to talk more specifically and adroitly about what's in this legislation, as opposed to just sort of mumbling through it."

"And this is coming from a guy who has known and likes Joe Biden," he added.

It's a point that highlights the paradox of this presidency.

A man whose administration can point to significant legislative successes on some of the thorniest issues - infrastructure spending, gun control and now climate - doesn't seem to be able to get the credit."
