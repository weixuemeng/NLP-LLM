Discussion Name:
Was Donald Trump a Good President?

1. Thesis:
Donald Trump was a good president.

  1.1. Pro:
  The success of President Trump's policies meant that he was one of the best presidents.

    1.1.1. Pro:
    President Trump reformed all aspects of the US's immigration system, reducing both legal and illegal immigration.

      1.1.1.1. Pro:
      The Trump administration reduced illegal immigration, which is a drain [1] on the US economy.

        1.1.1.1.1. Pro:
        President Trump planned to introduce [2] a new merit-based system for legal immigration to the US, where those who could positively contribute to the economy would be given visas.

          1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro:
          President Trump called for an overhaul of the immigration system to make it merit-based [3] rather than lottery-based.

            1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
            The primary effect of this policy will be more competition for well-paying jobs, likely with lower wages as a result.

              1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
              There will be many effects, and the above claim is a gross simplification. The policy will bring much-needed skills into the country which will boost wealth for everyone in the long run. It will also increase wages for low skilled jobs as employers will be less able to rely on illegal immigrants who are willing to work for less money for a variety of reasons.

            1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con:
            As a candidate who is unreliable and often [4] lies [5], the immigration policies that Trump actually moved forward with are far more telling than the policies that he claimed he intended to pursue.

            1.1.1.1.1.1.3. Con:
            Conversely, President Trump has also called for reducing [6] the number of H1-B visas - highly qualified people who should have a lot of merit.

        1.1.1.1.2. Con:
        Immigrants provide great economic benefit and have a negligible fiscal impact.

          1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro:
          A wide variety of meta-analyses and studies [7] have never demonstrated that immigration has ever presented an undue burden on state or government budgets.

          1.1.1.1.2.2. Pro:
          It is widely accepted that immigrants present a massive boon [8] to economic activity.

          1.1.1.1.2.3. Pro:
          The benefits of immigrants are accepted even by fervently anti-immigration economists [9].

          1.1.1.1.2.4. Pro:
          All economies not only require skilled workers, but the laborers to bring these skilled workers' ambitions to fruition. If we take the argument that President Trump managed an 'economic miracle', he would have needed an increased supply of labor to facilitate this expansion.

        1.1.1.1.3. Con:
        The vast majority of illegal immigration into the US does not come from border-crossing, but from people overstaying their visas [10]. President Trump did a poor job addressing this

        1.1.1.1.4. Con:
        The illegal immigrant population in the US has been steadily declining since its peak in 2007 [11]. There is no evidence that President Trump significantly decreased it.

      1.1.1.2. Con:
      There is no evidence that illegal immigration rates have reduced since President Trump was sworn into office.

        1.1.1.2.1. Con:
        From 2017 to 2019, there was an increase in the number of detentions at the borders [12].

        1.1.1.2.2. Pro:
        The number of unauthorized immigrants in the US started to decline before Trump's administration [13].

      1.1.1.3. Con:
      President Trump's immigration policies [14] were cruel and did not advance compassion, diversity, or humanity.

        1.1.1.3.1. Pro:
        President Trump's immigration policies encouraged family separation [15].

        1.1.1.3.2. Pro:
        There have been cases of coerced sterilization [16] at immigration detention centers.

        1.1.1.3.3. Con:
        Many of President Trump's immigration policies were continuations [17] of Obama-era policies.

          1.1.1.3.3.1. Con:
          Obama and Trump did not [18] have the same policies.

        1.1.1.3.4. Pro:
        Refugee admissions into the US fell drastically under Trump's presidency [19].

          1.1.1.3.4.1. Pro:
          President Trump almost eliminated asylum in the US [20].

        1.1.1.3.5. Con:
        The large number of migrants that were making their way to US borders to gain US residency suggested people from other countries desired [21] to live in a country under President Trump.

          1.1.1.3.5.1. Con:
          This is a post hoc ergo propter hoc [22] claim. That Trump is president and that a large number of migrants are trying to gain US residency does not suggest that the former causes the latter.

          1.1.1.3.5.2. Pro:
          There's a large number of migrants fleeing poverty, corruption and warlike/lawless conditions to what has since it's conception been touted as a land of opportunity.

      1.1.1.4. Pro:
      From 2016 to July 2020, President Trump reduced legal immigration [23] by 49%.

        1.1.1.4.1. Con:
        Reducing legal immigration is not aligned with American values.

        1.1.1.4.2. Con:
        Restrictions on legal immigration [24] impact both legal asylum seekers and high-skill immigrants [25], who greatly benefit the economy [26] by working hard and starting companies [27] that employ Americans.

      1.1.1.5. Con:
      President Trump's immigration policies [28] caused human rights abuses.

        1.1.1.5.1. Con:
        President Trump was effective [29] at dealing with people who had entered the country illegally.

          1.1.1.5.1.1. Con:
          President Trump also separated [30] families who entered the country legally.

        1.1.1.5.2. Con:
        President Trump showed his support of human rights when he stuck up for the oppressed citizens of foreign countries, such as Iran [31], and promoted their culture.

          1.1.1.5.2.1. Pro:
          President Trump has demonstrated the strength of the US against China [32], and with his backing, Asian countries being bullied by China [33] will keep their sovereignty [34].

            1.1.1.5.2.1.1. Pro:
            President Trump supported a strong image of the US.

        1.1.1.5.3. Pro:
        President Trump's attempts to reduce both legal [35] and illegal [36] immigration appeared inhumane [37], and clearly racially motivated [38], to the degree that it was liable to have a damaging impact [39] on America's future.

          1.1.1.5.3.1. Con:
          According to President Trump [40], the immigration crackdown was motivated by a desire to enforce the law, which is a core duty of the president.

            1.1.1.5.3.1.1. Con:
            President Trump's family separation policy was against [41] the law.

            1.1.1.5.3.1.2. Con:
            If we knew President Trump's motivation, this would be a strong claim; however, motivation is a difficult thing to discern a priori, and we didn't know President Trump's motivation.

              1.1.1.5.3.1.2.1. Pro:
              Moreover, we cannot believe what he said [42] most of the time, so his documented statements are of little use in determining what his motivations were.

          1.1.1.5.3.2. Con:
          -> See 1.1.1.5.1.

          1.1.1.5.3.3. Con:
          The crackdown on immigration from certain countries with significant internal problems linked with terrorism was ruled constitutional [43] in 2018, and so it was neither inhumane nor racist.

            1.1.1.5.3.3.1. Con:
            Under President Trump, the US took the unprecedented step [44] of firing tear gas, a chemical weapon, on an unarmed civilian refugee column, composed of a high percentage of women and children, across a border, onto foreign soil.

            1.1.1.5.3.3.2. Con:
            A policy being ruled constitutional does not mean that it can't be racist or inhumane.

              1.1.1.5.3.3.2.1. Pro:
              Upon constitutional founding, black people were worth 3/5ths [45] of a person. Many policies after the civil war have continued to either outright discriminate, or have been used overtly in discriminatory fashion.

            1.1.1.5.3.3.3. Pro:
            The US Constitution protects human rights [46], so if the crackdown was ruled constitutional, then it was not an abuse of human rights.

          1.1.1.5.3.4. Con:
          -> See 1.1.1.1.1.1.

          1.1.1.5.3.5. Pro:
          The impact of his 'zero-tolerance [47]' policy, with increased levels of familial separation and unacceptable human rights abuses, was very clear [48].

            1.1.1.5.3.5.1. Con:
            The clear impact is that America is slowly but surely stemming the flow of criminals into the country (p. 1 [49]).

              1.1.1.5.3.5.1.1. Con:
              The numbers shown are actually lower than previous years. [50] This means that the policies are having no noticeable or observable effect and that if anything, the previous administration could take the credit.

          1.1.1.5.3.6. Pro:
          President Trump made false and misleading claims [51] about chain migration [52].

            1.1.1.5.3.6.1. Con:
            Chain immigration claims may have been exaggerated, but they were basically correct. The idea of having a lottery to let people into a country is questionable and President Trump was right to criticise it.

          1.1.1.5.3.7. Pro:
          President Trump signed an executive order for a travel ban that prohibited entry from seven countries [53], five of which were majority Muslim, for national security reasons. These countries never posed a national security threat to the US

            1.1.1.5.3.7.1. Pro:
            None of the deadly terrorist attackers [54] have been from the countries that were banned by this order.

            1.1.1.5.3.7.2. Pro:
            The list of countries with the imposed travel ban didn't include [55] Muslim majority countries in which President Trump had historical or current business ties.

            1.1.1.5.3.7.3. Pro:
            In December 2015, President Trump called for a 'complete shutdown [56]' of Muslim entry to the US.

            1.1.1.5.3.7.4. Con:
            President Trump stated that the travel ban was only temporary and that the US would resume issuing visas to these countries once "the most secure policies" [57] were in place.

        1.1.1.5.4. Pro:
        President Trump reversed his zero-tolerance policy in 2018 [58].

    1.1.2. Con:
    President Trump was unable to combat COVID-19 effectively.

      1.1.2.1. Pro:
      On February 8th, 2020, the CDC produced thousands of failed tests [59] that would have slowed the virus and allowed for tracing and fewer restrictions of who could be tested.

      1.1.2.2. Pro:
      During Trump's presidency, the US had one of the world's highest mortality rates [60] from COVID-19.

        1.1.2.2.1. Con:
        One-third of the death count came from California, New York [61], and New Jersey [62]. President Trump didn't control anything in these federated, Democrat-run cities. This was scape-goating and indicated that the Democrats were unable to handle a health crisis.

        1.1.2.2.2. Pro:
        The US had the highest COVID-19 death rate recorded in high-income countries and led the world in the number of total pandemic deaths with 214,776 [63]. (October 2020).

      1.1.2.3. Con:
      It was not within Trump's power to keep people from spreading the virus–the president and government did their job by providing information and support.

        1.1.2.3.1. Con:
        The Trump administration closed testing centers in communities where cases were spiking. [64]

        1.1.2.3.2. Pro:
        88% of Americans [65] said in May 2020 that hospitals, health officials, and local officials did well responding to COVID-19.

        1.1.2.3.3. Con:
        Some of the information provided by president Trump was dangerously inaccurate.

          1.1.2.3.3.1. Pro:
          President Trump incorrectly suggested that injecting patients with disinfectant might help treat COVID-19 [66].

      1.1.2.4. Con:
      President Trump closed down the US [67] almost immediately when COVID-19 was announced by the WHO [68].

        1.1.2.4.1. Con:
        The US wasn't the only country to close down, as many other countries also imposed travel restrictions and bans [69].

          1.1.2.4.1.1. Pro:
          President Trump's travel ban restrictions came too late [70] compared to other European restrictions [71].

          1.1.2.4.1.2. Con:
          President Trump reacted efficiently as he imposed the measures on the same day that the World Health Organization [72] declared the outbreak a global pandemic.

        1.1.2.4.2. Pro:
        The White House released a list of President Trump’s historic COVID-19 responses [73].

        1.1.2.4.3. Con:
        On January 31st, 2020 [74], COVID-19 was declared a public health emergency in the US. President Trump declared a national emergency on March 13th [75] and granted $42 billion [76] to fight COVID-19.

          1.1.2.4.3.1. Pro:
          President Trump delayed taking necessary steps by up to six weeks [77] in some instances.

            1.1.2.4.3.1.1. Pro:
            Less than three weeks after telling Bob Woodward [78] the disease was very scary and deadlier than the flu [79], he repeatedly downplayed the threat to the American people and postponed lockdowns.

          1.1.2.4.3.2. Pro:
          Most Americans think President Trump was too slow with his "initial response to COVID-19 threat. [80]"

          1.1.2.4.3.3. Con:
          Most European countries didn't declare COVID-19 a national emergency until March 2020 [81].

        1.1.2.4.4. Pro:
        President Trump placed a 30-day travel ban on March 2020 [82] on anyone who had been to the European Schengen area, in order to prevent further spread of COVID-19.

      1.1.2.5. Con:
      President Trump's actions during the first year of COVID-19 indicated how committed he was to fighting the crisis.

        1.1.2.5.1. Con:
        President Trump's actions caused COVID-19 to become a pandemic with his abroad [83] and local [84] staff cuts.

          1.1.2.5.1.1. Pro:
          President Trump cut funding from the WHO [85] and canceled an order of 80,000 ventilators [86] because the price ($1 billion) was 'too unrealistic'.

            1.1.2.5.1.1.1. Con:
            With so many scams going on (like the fake PPE [87]), it makes sense to be cautious and figure out what makes sense before jumping in only to find out it isn't needed as much. There might've been something better and cheaper with what he was thinking, but we won't know if people think about why he thought it was too expensive, rather than what was his alternative.

          1.1.2.5.1.2. Con:
          COVID-19 was a pandemic [88] everywhere in the world independently of President Trump's actions.

            1.1.2.5.1.2.1. Con:
            When the US was about to enter a major economic crisis because of COVID-19 [89], President Trump dealt with the pandemic by going into denial.

              1.1.2.5.1.2.1.1. Pro:
              President Trump suffered the consequences of this denial in the 2020 presidential elections.

          1.1.2.5.1.3. Pro:
          President Trump's staff cuts [90] undermined COVID-19 containment efforts back at the beginning of the pandemic.

          1.1.2.5.1.4. Con:
          According to the White House [91], President Trump "led the largest mobilization of public and private sector resources since WWII."

        1.1.2.5.2. Pro:
        President Trump's increased Department of Defense spending contributed to the ability to run Operation Warp Speed [92], from May 15, 2020, with the aim of developing COVID-19 vaccine candidates faster and more effectively than private venture could.

          1.1.2.5.2.1. Pro:
          Thanks to Operation Warp Speed and the allocated $14 billion [93], President Trump ensured that the authorities, scientists, and companies’ efforts led to more unity in achieving the goal to find a vaccine.

          1.1.2.5.2.2. Con:
          The Operation Warp Speed failed to provide the promised deliveries of doses [94] and quickly exhausted reserve supplies. [95]

        1.1.2.5.3. Pro:
        President Trump donated [96] his 4th quarter salary for 2019 to fight the pandemic.

        1.1.2.5.4. Pro:
        President Trump moved the tax filing date [97] from April 15 to July 15 2020 in order to provide relief to Americans during the pandemic.

        1.1.2.5.5. Pro:
        On March 27th, 2020, President Trump signed the CARES Act [98], a COVID-19 relief bill of $2 trillion to prevent economic devastation.

        1.1.2.5.6. Con:
        Trump knew how serious the virus was [99] and hid the truth, downplaying the virus and doing nothing.

          1.1.2.5.6.1. Pro:
          If Trump had taken the virus seriously; the death toll would be notably less [100].

          1.1.2.5.6.2. Con:
          Information was available to the public about the dangers of the virus from other reputable domestic [101] and international [102] sources.

      1.1.2.6. Con:
      President Trump handled some health crises well.

        1.1.2.6.1. Pro:
        President Trump declared a state of emergency for opioid addiction [103] which provided funding and a dedicated task force.

          1.1.2.6.1.1. Con:
          A report from 2018 concluded that the emergency declaration didn't have many positive results [104].

          1.1.2.6.1.2. Pro:
          Positive outcomes have included prescription monitoring programs [105] and expanded treatment.

      1.1.2.7. Pro:
      President Trump made a number of baseless and irresponsible [106] claims about the COVID-19 pandemic.

        1.1.2.7.1. Pro:
        President Trump admitted [107] that he downplayed the seriousness of the virus from the start. He should have been more upfront about it and taken proper measures.

          1.1.2.7.1.1. Pro:
          Since late February 2020 [108], President Trump insisted the virus would magically disappear.

          1.1.2.7.1.2. Con:
          Other world leaders [109] also downplayed the virus from the start.

    1.1.3. Pro:
    President Trump's policies promoted a greater degree of freedom and liberty for American citizens and local government.

      1.1.3.1. Pro:
      Compared with other recent presidents, President Trump adopted a hands-free management approach that allowed local government greater leeway in making decisions, such as in the case of the pandemic [110].

      1.1.3.2. Con:
      President Trump didn't give the same freedom to all Americans, since he strengthened racial division [111].

      1.1.3.3. Pro:
      President Trump pushed for deregulation [112] during his administration, putting the responsibility of policymaking on the shoulders of the states, as intended in the US Constitution.

        1.1.3.3.1. Pro:
        President Trump removed many regulations [113], in keeping with his campaign promises [114].

          1.1.3.3.1.1. Con:
          Slashing environmental regulations is a terrible move which will lead to increased pollution, food poisoning, and so on.

          1.1.3.3.1.2. Con:
          The consequences of deregulation can destroy peoples [115] lives, lands, and freedoms.

          1.1.3.3.1.3. Pro:
          The Trump administration started 514 deregulatory rulemakings on a wide range of issues at different agencies (p. 26 [116]).

          1.1.3.3.1.4. Pro:
          Deregulation increases [117] free-market [118] competition, giving consumers more choice [119].

          1.1.3.3.1.5. Con:
          Removing regulations is only positive when the regulations are doing more harm than good. Blanket opposition to regulation can be highly destructive, as many regulations have been hard-won and serve to protect citizens.

          1.1.3.3.1.6. Con:
          President Trump honoring one promise didn't outweigh the numerous ways he reneged on promises or lied during the campaign [120], and in office.

        1.1.3.3.2. Con:
        Deregulation [121] was merely used for President Trump's corporate greed. Voters did not ask for it.

        1.1.3.3.3. Pro:
        According to a 2019 report by the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), Trump's administration reduced the size, scope, and cost of federal regulations for the first time in decades with noticeable results [122].

          1.1.3.3.3.1. Con:
          The CEA are appointed by and work directly for the president, so they are not an objective source of information about presidential policies.

        1.1.3.3.4. Con:
        Deregulation can often increase unhealthy risks taken by businesses [123].

        1.1.3.3.5. Con:
        Deregulation was a primary cause of the 2008 financial housing crisis [124].

        1.1.3.3.6. Con:
        Some regulations must be equally placed on all participating members (states) to ensure fair competition [125] in an open-market economy.

    1.1.4. Con:
    President Trump passed insignificant legislation, which was also broadly ineffective.

      1.1.4.1. Con:
      US legislation is passed by Congress, not the president.

        1.1.4.1.1. Pro:
        The US Constitution, Article I [126] states that "all legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives."

          1.1.4.1.1.1. Con:
          The final step of passing a bill into law is directly the responsibility of the President. They can pass, veto, or abstain from signing the laws. [127]

          1.1.4.1.1.2. Pro:
          When a representative sponsors a bill, it is then assigned to a committee for study. If released, it is then put on a calendar to be voted on (by simple majority), debated or amended. If voted, the bill moves to the Senate [128].

        1.1.4.1.2. Con:
        It is generally understood that a president passes laws through Congress [129]. Many presidents have passed laws.

      1.1.4.2. Con:
      President Trump signed the First Step Act into law [130], marking the first legislative victory in years for advocates seeking to reform the criminal justice system at the federal level.

      1.1.4.3. Con:
      President Trump passed the VA Accountability Act [131], allowing the firing of civil servants who mistreat veterans.

        1.1.4.3.1. Con:
        To call this 'significant' is stretching the meaning of the word.

      1.1.4.4. Con:
      President Trump passed the VA Mission Act [132], which allows veterans to see a private doctor if they've been waiting too long for treatment.

        1.1.4.4.1. Con:
        -> See 1.1.4.3.1.

      1.1.4.5. Pro:
      A member within President Trump's administration [133] has branded his leadership style ineffective and his actual results non-existent.

        1.1.4.5.1. Con:
        The NYT op-ed is an unacceptable attack on President Trump, possibly from what has been termed the 'deep state': working and briefing against the president [134], and attempting to thwart [135] his democratic mandate.

          1.1.4.5.1.1. Pro:
          Their anonymous, cowardly, and narcissistic attacks [136] have been widely criticized on both the left and right. [137]

            1.1.4.5.1.1.1. Con:
            While it is true that it has been criticised on both the left and right [138], the reasons are wildly different. To conflate and group them together is a grave disservice to both arguments and a disingenuous way to launch an attack.

          1.1.4.5.1.2. Con:
          An opinion piece in a newspaper hardly counts as a reliable source for the existence of the deep state.

            1.1.4.5.1.2.1. Pro:
            The deep state [139] conspiracy theory came to prominence during President Trump's election and campaign and has been furthered by his supporters without evidence.

              1.1.4.5.1.2.1.1. Pro:
              TDS (Trump Derangement Syndrome) [140] is a label President Trump and his supporters commonly use.

                1.1.4.5.1.2.1.1.1. Pro:
                Many therapists claim [141] there is no such thing as TAD or TDS [142] and it is instead "partisan pop psychology".

                  1.1.4.5.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro:
                  It is not an officially [143] recognized diagnosis. Even if there were anxiety, many would consider it justifiable [144] given the President's actions.

              1.1.4.5.1.2.1.2. Pro:
              President Trump had a tendency to label anything negative about himself as "fake news," while doing nothing to discourage or attack other sources of fake news, such as Pizzagate [145].

              1.1.4.5.1.2.1.3. Pro:
              President Trump frequently used the terms "#NoCollusion [146]" and "#WitchHunt [147]" when the investigation still being on-going. These statements appeared to be politically motivated.

              1.1.4.5.1.2.1.4. Pro:
              During his presidential campaign, Trump frequently led chants of "Drain the Swamp" [148] and "Lock her up" [149], two things he made no serious effort to address once he became President.

            1.1.4.5.1.2.2. Pro:
            The deep state [150] displays all the hall [151] marks [152] of a conspiracy [153] theory [154]. And just as much evidence [155]. Interestingly [156], the definition [157] of who or what the deep state is changes based on the speaker and their goals at the time.

            1.1.4.5.1.2.3. Con:
            Anonymous officials working against President Trump met the definition of the deep state. The op-ed was precisely the definition of proof.

          1.1.4.5.1.3. Pro:
          The "deep state [158]" refers to "elements of government and parts of top-level finance and industry that is effectively able to govern the United States without reference to the consent of the governed as expressed through the formal political process."

            1.1.4.5.1.3.1. Pro:
            The anonymous author of the NYT op-ed admitted to either being and/or working with unelected officials seeking to thwart the goals of the electorate as expressed through the election of President Trump, thus meeting the definition.

      1.1.4.6. Pro:
      President Trump spent minimal time [159] doing his job, giving the impression of laziness.

        1.1.4.6.1. Pro:
        President Trump made 285 trips to play golf [160] during his time in office.

          1.1.4.6.1.1. Pro:
          These trips are estimated to have cost American taxpayers $142 million [161].

        1.1.4.6.2. Pro:
        President Trump spent the majority of his working hours in the vaguely titled and unstructured "Executive Time [162]."

        1.1.4.6.3. Con:
        As president of the US, President Trump had staff with him at all times, so it was possible for him to work while traveling away from the White House; he was not necessarily being lazy.

      1.1.4.7. Pro:
      Corporate America reached the point of working around [163] President Trump rather than waiting for him to pass legislation that would benefit the sector.

      1.1.4.8. Pro:
      Many of Trump's legislative achievements were executive orders [164], which are easy for a subsequent administration to undo.

      1.1.4.9. Pro:
      President Trump mishandled [165] and mismanaged the disaster relief of Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria and has since denied this without providing evidence.

      1.1.4.10. Pro:
      President Trump did not demonstrate the managerial ability to build and maintain a stable administrative team around him, which reflected negatively on him as a president.

        1.1.4.10.1. Pro:
        It has been frequently claimed that President Trump didn't read [166] briefings [167] or memos [168], had a low attention [169] span [170], was fact resistant [171], and didn't care [172] for the [173] rule of law. [174]

          1.1.4.10.1.1. Pro:
          It has alternately been claimed that President Trump didn't like to read, or that he may have actually been functionally illiterate [175], even possibly dyslexic.

        1.1.4.10.2. Pro:
        The unbelievable rate of firings and/or resignations in President Trump's team was unprecedented [176].

          1.1.4.10.2.1. Pro:
          President Trump gave roles in his administration to his son, his daughter, and his son-in-law. Despite evidence [177] that two of them may have committed [178] potentially criminal wrongdoing and potentially [179] even illegal [180] acts [181], President Trump [182] kept them [183] while releasing others. This might have been a sign of nepotism [184], hardly an effective management style.

            1.1.4.10.2.1.1. Pro:
            It also raised conflict [185] of interest [186] issues.

          1.1.4.10.2.2. Pro:
          Conversely, a bad leader would refuse to admit or acknowledge mistakes and would not fire even critically inept staff. There were members of his team [187] that President Trump refused [188] to fire or replace due [189] to their [190] personal [191] loyalty [192] to him [193].

          1.1.4.10.2.3. Con:
          President Trump was elected with a mandate to 'drain the swamp' and change the way politics operated, and so it would have been surprising if he did follow precedent. He had an electoral mandate to be unprecedented, and it was, therefore, a sign that he was fulfilling his pledge to the American people.

            1.1.4.10.2.3.1. Con:
            It can hardly be said that filling the administration with sycophants, family members, donors (or donor puppets) and rich friends equates to "draining the swamp".

            1.1.4.10.2.3.2. Con:
            If he were actually engaging in 'draining the swamp' we would expect to see him firing a great many people, certainly, but we would not expect him to be firing the very people he brought in with the regularity that he has been.

        1.1.4.10.3. Con:
        Good leaders know when to make managerial changes. The job of a productive president is fast-paced. If he made bad picks, he should have figured out how to fix and replace those appointments quickly.

          1.1.4.10.3.1. Con:
          President Trump [194] has [195] invited this [196] criticism of [197] himself [198] through his [199] own [200] words [201] and [202] his [203] appointments [204].

        1.1.4.10.4. Pro:
        President Trump's cabinet choices were chiefly opponents of the office they held and were corrupt [205] forces [206].

          1.1.4.10.4.1. Con:
          It has now been shown that the Russia FBI investigation into him was politically motivated [207].

            1.1.4.10.4.1.1. Con:
            That as may be, nineteen people and three companies [208] have been indicted. There was genuine corruption to be found, regardless of motive.

              1.1.4.10.4.1.1.1. Con:
              None of these indictments relate to the campaign, so the conclusion of genuine corruption is false.

            1.1.4.10.4.1.2. Con:
            That assertion was jumped to by a partisan Republican party, but the investigation was still underway and individuals tied to the campaign were pleading guilty.

              1.1.4.10.4.1.2.1. Con:
              This is not true - it was evidenced by the clearly biased actions and motives [209] of Clinton idealogue Peter Strzok abusing his position in the FBI to further his political agenda [210], for which he had been fired.

                1.1.4.10.4.1.2.1.1. Con:
                No motivation of bias was found in his conduct [211] or investigations; he also investigated Hillary Clinton.

                1.1.4.10.4.1.2.1.2. Con:
                The investigation was called for by thousands of citizens, congressmen, political opinion writers, and more, months before anyone knew Peter Strzok's name.

          1.1.4.10.4.2. Pro:
          President Trump's Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross [212], has been accused of corruption.

          1.1.4.10.4.3. Pro:
          Several of President Trump's campaign managers are in prison [213] for various crimes.

          1.1.4.10.4.4. Con:
          Being opponents of the actions previously taken in the name of the offices they hold is not corruptive, but rather essential in a healthy and functioning democracy.

            1.1.4.10.4.4.1. Con:
            This is anti-democratic, flying in the face of countless thousands of sections of law, undermining the democratically documented will of the republic.

            1.1.4.10.4.4.2. Con:
            This strategy is a massive waste of tax payer dollars. The programs that are being undermined were never de-funded.

            1.1.4.10.4.4.3. Con:
            Selecting a supreme court justice based on his previous comments that the president should not be held accountable for any crime is explicitly corrupt.

        1.1.4.10.5. Con:
        It is unclear whether his managerial style showed good judgment, as there were two completely different stories [214] on the goings-on in the White House. A negative picture was painted by anonymous people or people with little credibility [215], while a positive picture was painted by everyone else who worked or had worked there.

          1.1.4.10.5.1. Con:
          There were three different sources for the conflict and turmoil in the White House - the book [216], the opinion article [217], and Omarosa [218].

            1.1.4.10.5.1.1. Con:
            The combined weight of three things that carry no weight is nothing. There is no credible source willing to lend their name to the rumours, yet plenty of respectable people who have said on the record that they do not recognise the anonymous descriptions.

              1.1.4.10.5.1.1.1. Con:
              Bob Woodward is a Pulitzer prize wining journalist, who has published 18 political books. Alll 18 have been national bestsellers and 12 of them have been No. 1 national nonfiction bestsellers—more No. 1 national nonfiction bestsellers than any contemporary author. He was one of two journalists that did most of the investigation and reporting on the Watergate Scandal. Woodward himself has been a recipient of nearly every major American journalism award. This gives his words weight.

                1.1.4.10.5.1.1.1.1. Con:
                The above claim is a great example of the “appeal to authority [219]” fallacy.

              1.1.4.10.5.1.1.2. Con:
              Many of the key people rejecting the story would lose power by publicly accepting it, which is a possible motivation to lie.

            1.1.4.10.5.1.2. Con:
            Omarosa appeared to have recorded most of her time in the White House, and yet none of her tapes released that far suggested a White House in chaos or unreasonable behaviour by President Trump.

          1.1.4.10.5.2. Con:
          When comparing the story of Bob Woodward, a twice-Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist (who covered Watergate and 8 presidencies) and the story of a politician, one can expect the stories to be inconsistent.

            1.1.4.10.5.2.1. Pro:
            Vice President Pence would deliver whatever statement painted his office and his party in the best light, as would every senior White House staff member. They were not beholden to the truth.

            1.1.4.10.5.2.2. Con:
            This would not be the first time Bob Woodward got the wrong end of the stick. His biography on John Belushi was criticised [220] as "unfair," "humorless" and "depressing", and which a subsequent biographer found very troubling. [221]

              1.1.4.10.5.2.2.1. Con:
              This is less an example of Bob Woodward getting a story “completely wrong” and more an example of two writers having different attitudes about the subject. The writer of the article above even acknowledges that Woodward was generally correct with the facts, but assembled them to the wrong overall story in their mind.

                1.1.4.10.5.2.2.1.1. Pro:
                A quote from the article explains that this book is not a great representation of Woodward’s overall body of work: “Wired is an anomaly in the Woodward catalog, the only book he’s ever written about a subject other than Washington.“

          1.1.4.10.5.3. Con:
          Bob Woodward [222] was neither anonymous (though admittedly, his sources were), nor lacked credibility.

          1.1.4.10.5.4. Pro:
          UN Ambassador and former Governor Nikki Haley said that [223] Woodward's book should have been taken with a grain of salt'.

          1.1.4.10.5.5. Pro:
          President Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, made the point [224] that Woodward's book included an unflattering anecdote involving him, which Giuliani claimed it was false. Woodward never tried to interview Giuliani about it and left Woodward open to the charge that he relied too much on second-hand accounts rather than primary sources.

            1.1.4.10.5.5.1. Con:
            An 'unflattering anecdote' may well have been something Giuliani wished to distance himself from.

            1.1.4.10.5.5.2. Con:
            Bob Woodward claimed [225] to have tapes of all interviews and quotes and said he would release them if anyone publicly asked or claimed to have been misquoted.

              1.1.4.10.5.5.2.1. Pro:
              President Trump claimed [226] that he never spoke to Woodward in any capacity. While this was true for the content of the book, Woodward [227] released [228] a tape [229] showing [230] that he did in fact speak to Trump just before the book's launch.

      1.1.4.11. Con:
      President Trump also removed the Obamacare individual mandate [231], which was the key objection of Republicans to Obamacare.

        1.1.4.11.1. Pro:
        President Trump repealed elements of the Affordable Healthcare Act by executive order [232], costing Americans a fortune.

          1.1.4.11.1.1. Con:
          President Trump failed to replace the Affordable Care Act [233] with anything meaningful, so he only fulfilled half of his promise.

          1.1.4.11.1.2. Con:
          The Affordable Healthcare Act lowered the growth of long-term spending and government costs by over $1 trillion [234], due to the cost controls it included.

          1.1.4.11.1.3. Pro:
          By developing policies to increase health care competition and choice, President Trump improved the quality of health care and lowered the prices (p. 171 [235]).

            1.1.4.11.1.3.1. Con:
            US healthcare remains among the most expensive [236] in the world.

              1.1.4.11.1.3.1.1. Pro:
              This cripples many lower and middle class families who cannot afford healthcare.

            1.1.4.11.1.3.2. Pro:
            The Trump Administration lowered prescription drug prices [237], expanded access to affordable coverage, and allowed Americans to access trusted doctors.

          1.1.4.11.1.4. Pro:
          President Trump included a provision in his 2017 legislation to eliminate the ObamaCare penalt [238]y, which cost $695 per adult or 2.5% of household income.

            1.1.4.11.1.4.1. Con:
            Millions of people could lose their health insurance as a result of this repeal, many of them could die [239].

              1.1.4.11.1.4.1.1. Con:
              The people who will lose health insurance are those who do not want health insurance.

                1.1.4.11.1.4.1.1.1. Con:
                The people who would lose health insurance would be those that can't afford it [240].

              1.1.4.11.1.4.1.2. Pro:
              High deductible insurance was causing many people to forgo healthcare and important medications [241].

      1.1.4.12. Con:
      President Trump secured initial funding [242] for building a wall on the border with Mexico in 2018.

        1.1.4.12.1. Con:
        President Trump failed in his promise to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it [243].

          1.1.4.12.1.1. Pro:
          Not only was there no funding secured for building a wall, but President Trump also later denied he had ever claimed that Mexico would be paying for the wall [244].

          1.1.4.12.1.2. Pro:
          "I will build a great wall – and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me – and I’ll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.” - No element [245] of this was truthful, and it was ostensibly arrogant.

          1.1.4.12.1.3. Con:
          It was reported [246] that the US and Mexico were in the process of finalizing a trade deal that was more advantageous to the US than the previous one, which could have resulted in more tax revenue flowing in the US government coffers.

            1.1.4.12.1.3.1. Con:
            A trade deal with Mexico favoring the US didn't mean that Mexico would end up paying for the wall, the two are separate matters.

        1.1.4.12.2. Pro:
        The Trump administration notified Congress in February 2018 of its plans to divert $3.8 billion from the Defense Department's budget [247] to build the border wall.

        1.1.4.12.3. Con:
        A border wall is ineffective against tunnels [248] and sea routes [249].

        1.1.4.12.4. Con:
        Border patrol agents predicted that the wall would be ineffective [250] and hinder them [251] in doing their job by restricting visibility and line of sight.

          1.1.4.12.4.1. Pro:
          The wall has had many unintended side-effects [252].

          1.1.4.12.4.2. Pro:
          The effectiveness [253] of the wall [254] is still debatable [255], considered to be equal [256] to other equally costed measures, with many considering [257] it a waste of time [258].

          1.1.4.12.4.3. Con:
          Some sources suggest [259] the wall to be effective [260] and working, though the impartiality of these sources was disputed [261].

    1.1.5. Pro:
    President Trump strengthened the US global environmental policy.

      1.1.5.1. Con:
      President Trump's climate policies accelerated global warming [262].

      1.1.5.2. Pro:
      President Trump withdrew from the Iran Deal [263].

        1.1.5.2.1. Con:
        President Trump withdrew [264] from the Iran deal, which was ensuring Iran would not get a nuclear weapon.

        1.1.5.2.2. Pro:
        Iran's nuclear program is a threat to the peace and stability of the region [265], so President Trump's withdrawal from the Iran Deal and economic sanctions [266] were good foreign policy decisions.

        1.1.5.2.3. Con:
        Withdrawing from the Iran deal has had primarily negative consequences for the US (and the world) [267].

        1.1.5.2.4. Con:
        Withdrawing from the Iran Deal provided hardliners in the Iranian government more leverage against the US by confirming their position that the US can't be trusted to honor any agreement.

      1.1.5.3. Pro:
      President Trump withdrew from the Paris Climate Deal [268], which benefited the US financially [269].

        1.1.5.3.1. Con:
        Financial benefits will only matter for so much time until we all die.

          1.1.5.3.1.1. Pro:
          A good president has to provide for the future stability and well-being of the country and future generations, for long term stability and survival, not just immediate benefits regardless of costs or consequences in the future.

        1.1.5.3.2. Con:
        Withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement has had primarily negative consequences for the US.

        1.1.5.3.3. Pro:
        This saved the US billions of dollars in trying to stop the unstoppable [270] and allowed it to focus on more practical things like space research and escaping to Mars [271].

          1.1.5.3.3.1. Con:
          Even if escaping to Mars or elsewhere would have been a viable strategy, President Trump's propositions of cutting [272] NASA's budget showed no interest in supporting such a strategy.

          1.1.5.3.3.2. Con:
          The original article referenced doesn't say it was unstoppable or unavoidable, only that the target was unrealistic. It still argues, however, that we need to slow global warming to give ourselves more time to adapt and survive. The Paris accord, which President Trump unilaterally withdrew from, was a step in that direction, to buy time for future generations.

          1.1.5.3.3.3. Con:
          Escaping to Mars is not feasible with current technology and likely will remain so for many decades.

          1.1.5.3.3.4. Con:
          Migrating a large founder population (to avoid inbreeding depression) to another planet (or a even a space station in Earth orbit) is not technically feasible at the present time. Such a task would involve intractable social and political problems as well (who escapes; who is left behind).

        1.1.5.3.4. Con:
        The US, like all other countries in the agreement, was able to set its own goals and determine the cost of its fines for not reaching them. Pulling out of the agreement was a symbolic move against global cooperation intended to mitigate future risk.

    1.1.6. Con:
    President Trump's policies displayed a lack of concern or understanding on a number of important issues.

      1.1.6.1. Pro:
      President Trump worked to loosen gun control regulations [273] during a period of unprecedented gun violence in the US.

      1.1.6.2. Pro:
      President Trump had a flawed [274] understanding [275] of economics [276] and international politics.

        1.1.6.2.1. Pro:
        President Trump thought that trade wars were good things [277] and easy to win [278].

        1.1.6.2.2. Con:
        Some of President Trump's formulas for growing the US economy [279] worked, which showed his understanding of economics.

        1.1.6.2.3. Con:
        President Trump’s position towards Brexit and towards the European Union showed opportunism [280], which was a sign that he understood foreign affairs and international politics.

          1.1.6.2.3.1. Pro:
          President Trump had a clear foreign policy ideology [281] which, like all American presidents, drew on nationalism and opportunism.

          1.1.6.2.3.2. Con:
          His statements regarding Brexit [282] suggested that he had a limited understanding of such issues.

        1.1.6.2.4. Pro:
        The former chair of the US central bank, Janet Yellen, criticized President Trump's economic knowledge [283].

    1.1.7. Pro:
    President Trump's foreign policy achievements demonstrated that he was a good president.

      1.1.7.1. Con:
      Policies that appear to be good for the US in the short term are not necessarily good in the long term. The long-term ramifications of President Trump's foreign policy are likely to weaken US foreign relations in the future.

        1.1.7.1.1. Pro:
        Warming relations with Russia in the interest of peace is meaningless if it continues the policies that led to sanctions being imposed [284] in the first place.

          1.1.7.1.1.1. Pro:
          Russia [285] continued to support the Syrian regime of Bashar Al-Assad [286], despite his use of illegal chemical weapons [287].

        1.1.7.1.2. Pro:
        President Trump's criticism of NATO allies and move to reduce the NATO budget have weakened ties and trust among the organization, which could cause problems in the future.

          1.1.7.1.2.1. Con:
          This is a slippery slope argument. While criticising NATO could weaken ties and trust, it does not necessarily mean it will create a chain reaction of weakening NATO itself, which will then lead to problems of the future.

          1.1.7.1.2.2. Pro:
          We are already seeing some of those problems in Europe, Eastern Europe and Turkey.

            1.1.7.1.2.2.1. Pro:
            Turkey has bought Russian [288] Anti-Air and Missile Defense Systems [289], causing a possibly irreconcilable [290] rift within NATO [291], in defiance of the US [292]. This also [293] stalled defense contracts and partnerships with the US [294].

            1.1.7.1.2.2.2. Con:
            The current war in Ukraine shows that NATO could be a threat for the European security [295].

              1.1.7.1.2.2.2.1. Pro:
              Europe no longer feels it can rely on the US [296] in any role [297] – diplomatic [298] partner [299] in many roles [300], trade [301] partner [302] or for security, [303] and as such feels [304] it needs a [305] United European Army instead of NATO [306] (though many analysts forecast it will not be able to do so, only complement it [307]).

              1.1.7.1.2.2.2.2. Con:
              In the face of [308] renewed [309] Russian aggression [310], Eastern European [311] countries felt abandoned [312] by the US [313] and NATO [314] under President Trump's leadership [315].

        1.1.7.1.3. Pro:
        President Trump's criticisms of the WHO [316] were generally rebuffed by other developed nations. Withholding funding and sowing doubt and mistrust will likely have long-term consequences.

        1.1.7.1.4. Pro:
        Trump's behavior alienated many traditional US allies, such as Canada [317], Britain [318], Australia [319], Japan [320], Europe [321] and most other members of NATO [322]. This was unlikely to be in the long-term interest of the US.

          1.1.7.1.4.1. Con:
          NATO is stronger than it was before [323] Trump's Presidency, which shows that President Trump's behavior didn't alienate traditional allies.

          1.1.7.1.4.2. Pro:
          President Trump's actions also weakened ties with other countries, creating a space for other global powers such as China [324] to replace the US.

          1.1.7.1.4.3. Pro:
          The hegemony of the US over the world is due to its alliances and standing with other modern, powerful countries. Damaging these relations would also damage its strength.

        1.1.7.1.5. Con:
        Since US presidents are only elected for 4 years, [325] it is understandable that they would try to improve the country in the short term.

      1.1.7.2. Con:
      President Trump's actions [326] to pull troops out of Syria in October 2019, led to further death and another situation where America betrayed its allies.

        1.1.7.2.1. Pro:
        These actions threaten to further empower ISIS [327] as it was done without much planning and consultation with the US military or its allies.

        1.1.7.2.2. Pro:
        President Trump's decision to pull out of Syria was widely condemned by even his most ardent supporters [328].

        1.1.7.2.3. Con:
        President Trump's decision to pull troops out of Syria was justified because he wanted to put an end to what he called the US role as global policeman [329].

      1.1.7.3. Con:
      World leaders voiced their concerns about President Trump during his tenure.

        1.1.7.3.1. Pro:
        World leaders reacted with shock and distress [330] to President Trump's followers' attack on the US Capitol building on January 6, 2021.

        1.1.7.3.2. Pro:
        After Biden's victory in the 2020 election, world leaders expressed hope and relief [331].

        1.1.7.3.3. Con:
        Some leaders, like Putin [332], sympathized with President Trump.

        1.1.7.3.4. Con:
        North Korean leader, Kim Jong-Un [333], supported President Trump's reelection in 2020.

        1.1.7.3.5. Pro:
        Angela Merkel [334] commented negatively on the Trump administration's handling of the pandemic.

      1.1.7.4. Pro:
      President Trump left a good legacy in trade and diplomacy.

        1.1.7.4.1. Pro:
        President Trump's approach towards Russia was quite punitive.

          1.1.7.4.1.1. Pro:
          Under President Trump, the US military killed 200 Russian soldiers for crossing into US-controlled land in Syria [335].

            1.1.7.4.1.1.1. Pro:
            It was considered the "most lethal clash between US and Russian citizens since the end of the cold war [336]".

            1.1.7.4.1.1.2. Con:
            The presence of US troops in Syria was a violation of international law [337]. As opposed to this, Russia was invited there by the government of Syria.

          1.1.7.4.1.2. Pro:
          President Trump authorized the sale of lethal weapons [338] to Ukraine.

            1.1.7.4.1.2.1. Con:
            The weapons weren't used [339].

          1.1.7.4.1.3. Pro:
          Some of the toughest ever sanctions [340] on Putin's allies in Russia were put in place while Trump was president.

            1.1.7.4.1.3.1. Con:
            The sanctions mentioned were not the work of President Trump. The sanctions upheld in January 2017 were originally imposed by Obama [341], and those from August 2018 were pushed through by a veto-proof majority [342] in Congress.

              1.1.7.4.1.3.1.1. Pro:
              President Trump seemed [343] unwilling [344] to impose sanctions [345] on Russia.

          1.1.7.4.1.4. Pro:
          President Trump bombed Syria for crossing US red lines [346].

          1.1.7.4.1.5. Con:
          President Trump received massive criticism [347] from the Intelligence community [348] for taking Putin's side on Russian election meddling [349] at the Helsinki summit.

            1.1.7.4.1.5.1. Con:
            The intelligence community [350] is not something benevolent to take criticism from.

          1.1.7.4.1.6. Con:
          President Trump repeatedly ignored [351] the intelligence community's assessment [352] that Russia meddled in the US election.

          1.1.7.4.1.7. Con:
          President Trump changed the GOP platform to be friendlier to Russia [353].

            1.1.7.4.1.7.1. Con:
            Friendliness with other nations that promotes de-escalation is a good trait in a president.

          1.1.7.4.1.8. Con:
          President Trump tried to lift [354] sanctions on Russia after it invaded Crimea.

          1.1.7.4.1.9. Con:
          President Trump resisted placing sanctions on Russia even when they were passed and pushed for by Congress and the Senate.

            1.1.7.4.1.9.1. Pro:
            -> See 1.1.7.4.1.8.

            1.1.7.4.1.9.2. Pro:
            -> See 1.1.7.4.1.3.1.1.

          1.1.7.4.1.10. Con:
          President Trump's friendliness with Putin was not a good thing [355].

            1.1.7.4.1.10.1. Pro:
            President Trump also allowed Russian interference in the US election. In fact, he took the decisive action of publicly [356] asking [357] Putin [358] to hack [359] the DNC servers [360] (which the Russians promptly did [361]).

        1.1.7.4.2. Con:
        President Trump destroyed US foreign policy with his lack of diplomacy [362].

        1.1.7.4.3. Con:
        President Trump did not have knowledge of international affairs [363].

          1.1.7.4.3.1. Con:
          President Trump has been actively involved in US trade and foreign policy for at least 30 years [364].

            1.1.7.4.3.1.1. Con:
            There are good arguments to be made that neither his handling of international issues [365], nor of the domestic economy [366] can be considered successful.

              1.1.7.4.3.1.1.1. Pro:
              The US economy during Trump's presidency was strong as a result of President Obama's economic decisions [367]. Most of President Trump's decisions had a negligible or net negative effect [368] on the US economy.

                1.1.7.4.3.1.1.1.1. Con:
                Under Trump's administration, the median household income grew from $62,898 in 2016 to $68,703 in 2019 [369].

                1.1.7.4.3.1.1.1.2. Pro:
                Analysts [370] and economists [371] have argued that, outside of crisis situations, it takes two years or more for presidential decisions to have a noticeable effect on the US economy.

                  1.1.7.4.3.1.1.1.2.1. Con:
                  White House economist Kevin Hassett stated that President Trump deserved all the credit for the US economic 'inflection [372]'.

                  1.1.7.4.3.1.1.1.2.2. Pro:
                  This implies that the results can be attributed to Obama, not to President Trump.

              1.1.7.4.3.1.1.2. Pro:
              President Trump took many short-sighted, one-off decisions that resulted in the worsening of international issues.

                1.1.7.4.3.1.1.2.1. Pro:
                -> See 1.1.7.2.

                1.1.7.4.3.1.1.2.2. Pro:
                The embassy in Jerusalem and North Korean nuclear talks are great examples of President Trump taking one-off foreign policy decisions. (p. 47 [373])

                  1.1.7.4.3.1.1.2.2.1. Con:
                  Moving the US embassy to Jerusalem [374] allowed other countries to follow and recognize the capital.

                    1.1.7.4.3.1.1.2.2.1.1. Con:
                    Neither of these acts have increased the US's standing in the world. For a great part of the world it was considered controversial [375].

                      1.1.7.4.3.1.1.2.2.1.1.1. Con:
                      Controversy does not affect whether an act is positive or negative in the medium to long term.

                  1.1.7.4.3.1.1.2.2.2. Pro:
                  Neither of these actions have borne any significant fruit or have set any long-term actionable policy that could be considered achievements with lasting positive effects for US foreign policy. (p. 68 [376])

                  1.1.7.4.3.1.1.2.2.3. Pro:
                  Moving the Israeli embassy was a short-sighted policy [377] that perpetuates the Israeli-Palestinian conflict indefinitely and rules out the US as an objective broker in the peace process.

                1.1.7.4.3.1.1.2.3. Pro:
                President Trump ordered an illegal [378] act of war [379] when the US killed Qassem Soleimani [380].

                  1.1.7.4.3.1.1.2.3.1. Pro:
                  This prompted Iran to send missiles [381] at US bases in Iraq; the first time there has been direct military engagement between Iran and the US since 1979.

                  1.1.7.4.3.1.1.2.3.2. Pro:
                  After being asked to withdraw troops by Abdul Mahdi, President Trump further escalated matters by refusing, threatening Iraq with sanctions that would "make Iranian sanctions look somewhat tame" [382] and demanding reimbursement for American investments in Iraqi military facilities.

                  1.1.7.4.3.1.1.2.3.3. Pro:
                  President Trump ordered an illegal act by assassinating an official of a neutral country in the airport of an ally and causing the deaths of allied officials as collateral damage, according to Iran's foreign minister [383], the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq [384], and the Iranian ambassador [385].

                    1.1.7.4.3.1.1.2.3.3.1. Pro:
                    President Trump violated several long-standing, unofficial policies [386]. This was unlikely to boost [387] the US's image [388] or make allies likely [389] to trust or cooperate [390] with the US in the future.

              1.1.7.4.3.1.1.3. Pro:
              -> See 1.1.7.1.4.

            1.1.7.4.3.1.2. Pro:
            President Trump’s success with specific international issues, like North Korea [391], suggested that he had knowledge and experience in issues associated with being an effective president.

              1.1.7.4.3.1.2.1. Con:
              According to some experts, President Trump made the situation worse [392] with North Korea.

              1.1.7.4.3.1.2.2. Pro:
              Korea expert, Victor Cha [393], gave credits to President Trump for the negotiations.

        1.1.7.4.4. Pro:
        President Trump moved the US Embassy to Jerusalem [394], which was a bold move to strengthen America's global standing.

          1.1.7.4.4.1. Con:
          The US embassy move was a personal decision [395] by President Trump that had less to do with governance of the US and more to do with reelection.

            1.1.7.4.4.1.1. Pro:
            President Trump named Jared Kushner (whose family had strong ties to Israel) as his senior adviser [396] to the president, to favour with those who supported Jewish or Israel’s interests.

          1.1.7.4.4.2. Pro:
          -> See 1.1.7.4.3.1.1.2.2.1.

          1.1.7.4.4.3. Pro:
          Moving the US Embassy showed that the US is truly committed to peace [397] in Jerusalem—there would be no reason to place US ambassadors in jeopardy otherwise.

            1.1.7.4.4.3.1. Pro:
            Moving the US Embassy [398] meant that its location could no longer be a point of contention in peace negotiations between Israel and Palestine.

              1.1.7.4.4.3.1.1. Con:
              One result of the decision to move the US embassy to Jerusalem was that the US was no longer seen as neutral or a good faith actor by the Palestinians, which has only served to heighten and inflame tensions. This move removed any façade of neutrality. [399]

            1.1.7.4.4.3.2. Con:
            In that case, it showed a fundamental misunderstanding, or complete lack of care and interest of the situation in Israel and of the grievances of the Palestinians.

          1.1.7.4.4.4. Con:
          -> See 1.1.7.4.3.1.1.2.2.3.

        1.1.7.4.5. Pro:
        President Trump challenged China's unfair trade practices [400].

          1.1.7.4.5.1. Con:
          President Trump frequently conducted trade with the Chinese, including selling Trump-branded merchandise made in China [401].

            1.1.7.4.5.1.1. Con:
            The Trump-branded merchandise that was made in China was probably unofficial [402]. Official Trump-branded merchandise appears to be entirely made in the US.

          1.1.7.4.5.2. Pro:
          President Trump stated in August 2019 that a "tough stance on China’s economic and trade policies would ultimately benefit the American economy [403]."

          1.1.7.4.5.3. Con:
          China exploited the political divisions within the US during the Trump administration.

            1.1.7.4.5.3.1. Pro:
            China signed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership [404] during the Trump administration, which placed China at the centre of global supply chains.

          1.1.7.4.5.4. Pro:
          President Trump's administration imposed tariffs worth more than US $360 billion [405] on Chinese goods.

        1.1.7.4.6. Con:
        President Trump's trade policies undermined the longstanding confidence [406] and trust of global markets in utilizing the US dollar as a standard currency.

          1.1.7.4.6.1. Pro:
          President Trump held a 17th-century [407], zero-sum view [408] of international trade, which was refuted [409] by economists [410] of all stripes.

            1.1.7.4.6.1.1. Pro:
            He supports anti-trade policies such as tariffs [411] and has opposed free trade deals such as the TPP [412] and NAFTA while failing to recognize the zero-sum nature of them.

      1.1.7.5. Con:
      President Trump was disrespectful [413] towards foreign [414] leaders [415] and heads of state [416].

        1.1.7.5.1. Pro:
        His hate-speech rhetoric widens the diplomatic gap between the US and most European countries and has been shown to bring discrimination and human rights violations to new heights [417].

      1.1.7.6. Con:
      President Trump seemed unwilling to stand up to, or take a stand against, foreign governments [418], even when they murdered [419] American residents [420], such as in the case of Jamal Khashoggi [421].

      1.1.7.7. Pro:
      President Trump made it clear that he didn't want a nuclear confrontation [422] and didn't react hastily [423] to provocative actions made by other nations.

        1.1.7.7.1. Con:
        Stating an opposition to nuclear war should not be considered a foreign policy achievement; it should be considered standard messaging.

          1.1.7.7.1.1. Pro:
          Not being a warmonger, not wanting nuclear confrontation, and not reacting hastily to provocative actions of other nations could be seen as positive traits in a president, but do not prove that President Trump's foreign policy was successful.

          1.1.7.7.1.2. Pro:
          -> See 1.1.5.2.1.

          1.1.7.7.1.3. Con:
          Since there have been so many nuclear war close calls [424], it is important for a President to publicly state his opposition to it.

        1.1.7.7.2. Con:
        President Trump's escalation of war in several countries led to the unnecessary deaths [425] of thousands of civilians.

          1.1.7.7.2.1. Pro:
          -> See 1.1.7.4.3.1.1.2.3.

          1.1.7.7.2.2. Pro:
          President Trump directed the killing of Soleimani, the Iranian Major General [426], which was "akin to Iran assassinating the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff [as] an act of war." This greatly destabilized the region and increased the threat of war.

          1.1.7.7.2.3. Pro:
          President Trump sold billions [427] of dollars' worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia, one of the most repressive regimes in the world [428]. The Saudis were using these weapons to obliterate Yemen [429] in a conflict that was more a massacre than a war.

        1.1.7.7.3. Pro:
        President Trump dramatically lowered tensions with North Korea.

          1.1.7.7.3.1. Con:
          President Trump stated in a speech to the UN “if [the US] is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea [430].” It is hard to imagine a more extreme response than his stated intention.

          1.1.7.7.3.2. Pro:
          North Korea has not tested a nuclear weapon since September 2017 [431].

            1.1.7.7.3.2.1. Con:
            They just had some kind of problem with their test site [432].

          1.1.7.7.3.3. Pro:
          North Korea was engaged in negotiations and dialogue with the US, exchanging very warm letters [433] between the two leaders.

            1.1.7.7.3.3.1. Con:
            President Trump being on close terms with a known dictator isn't necessarily a good thing. Many people perceived this as dangerous or alarming.

          1.1.7.7.3.4. Pro:
          North Korean media has toned down [434] anti-US rhetoric.

          1.1.7.7.3.5. Pro:
          President Trump halted [435] provocative military exercises with South Korea.

            1.1.7.7.3.5.1. Con:
            President Trump did so unilaterally without consulting South Korea [436]. Much [437] to the consternation [438] of South Korea [439] and Japan [440], two [441] of America's traditional [442] allies [443], somewhat straining [444] relationships with them.

              1.1.7.7.3.5.1.1. Con:
              South Korea deviated from a common US-Japan-SK line first when they invited the North to the Olympics [445] in spring 2018.

            1.1.7.7.3.5.2. Con:
            President Trump's stated reasoning was often inconsistent and at times contradictory: with regards to North Korea and war games in South Korea, he himself indicated it was for economic reasons [446], not just, or possibly even primarily, diplomatic ones.

              1.1.7.7.3.5.2.1. Con:
              President Trump also stated that it was because they were provocative: "We are going to get out of the war games that cost so much money because number one I think it’s very provocative. I want to do it and I think they’re [North Korea] very happy about it because it is so provocative [447].”

          1.1.7.7.3.6. Pro:
          The Trump administration successfully negotiated the return of three US hostages [448] with North Korea.

            1.1.7.7.3.6.1. Pro:
            In 2018, North Korea returned [449] the remains of US soldiers slain in the Korean war.

            1.1.7.7.3.6.2. Con:
            They also tortured Otto Warmbier [450] to death and transferred him out of their custody only for him to die within days.

              1.1.7.7.3.6.2.1. Con:
              This is highly disputed [451].

          1.1.7.7.3.7. Con:
          South Korea took the first steps to lower tensions.

            1.1.7.7.3.7.1. Pro:
            -> See 1.1.7.7.3.5.1.1.

          1.1.7.7.3.8. Con:
          North Korea continued to develop [452] nuclear weapons violating UN sanctions.

            1.1.7.7.3.8.1. Pro:
            North Korea was showing no signs [453] of slowing down its nuclear plans, despite President Trump's claims that North Korea was no longer a threat [454].

              1.1.7.7.3.8.1.1. Con:
              North Korea was still in negotiations, so it did not make sense for them to give up their ace card - namely their nuclear programme - until the negotiations were complete.

                1.1.7.7.3.8.1.1.1. Con:
                The negotiations have been ended [455].

              1.1.7.7.3.8.1.2. Pro:
              North Korea still posed a serious threat, as evidenced by Trump's U-turn [456] regarding North Korea, going from "There is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea" (which was patently untrue) to extending the state of national emergency [457] in place regarding North Korea. President Trump has achieved very little despite his statements to the contrary.

            1.1.7.7.3.8.2. Pro:
            National Security Adviser John Bolton [458] claims that North Korea has taken no steps [459] towards de-nuclearization.

              1.1.7.7.3.8.2.1. Pro:
              There is intelligence [460] to suggest that North Korea is continuing [461] to make fuel [462] for nuclear weapons.

              1.1.7.7.3.8.2.2. Pro:
              Experts [463] do not believe [464] N.Korea will de-nuclearize [465].

          1.1.7.7.3.9. Con:
          -> See 1.1.7.4.3.1.2.1.

          1.1.7.7.3.10. Con:
          The tensions between North Korea and South Korea (and the US) eased because of North Korea's newfound leverage [466], not because of President Trump's negotiation tactics, or name-calling strategy.

  1.2. Pro:
  President Trump was a proponent and protector of free speech in the US [467].

    1.2.1. Con:
    President Trump frequently attacked the press [468].

      1.2.1.1. Con:
      President Trump called out and criticized cancel culture [469] and the political correctness [470] of the press [471].

        1.2.1.1.1. Con:
        President Trump attacked cancel culture but he also used it during his presidency [472].

        1.2.1.1.2. Pro:
        President Trump rightly criticized cancel culture, as it represented a kind of censorship that could have become a threat to social justice [473].

      1.2.1.2. Pro:
      President Trump's attacks on the press were direct attacks on the US Constitution [474] and the freedom of the press [475].

        1.2.1.2.1. Pro:
        President Trump's press attacks dangerously undermined truth and consensus [476].

          1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro:
          President Trump used his Twitter account [477] to attack the press and undermine the truth.

        1.2.1.2.2. Pro:
        The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) [478] issued a report on President Trump's attacks on press credibility which endangered US democracy and global press freedom.

        1.2.1.2.3. Con:
        When President Trump attacked the press he was exercising his freedom of expression [479].

          1.2.1.2.3.1. Con:
          Freedom of expression is not absolute [480].

      1.2.1.3. Pro:
      Donald Trump used legal threats and actions to intimidate journalists who were critical of him.

        1.2.1.3.1. Pro:
        Trump sued Timothy O'Brien for his reporting on Trump's wealth. Trump subsequently admitted that he only did so to "make his life miserable [481]."

      1.2.1.4. Pro:
      President Trump has undermined the public's trust in the press [482] as a public service that provides information on relevant and current events.

        1.2.1.4.1. Pro:
        President Trump insisted that journalists were "the enemy of the people [483]" and popularized the phrase "fake news [484]", thus deeply corroding the confidence in an age-old American institution.

          1.2.1.4.1.1. Pro:
          President Trump attacked mainstream outlets as “enemies of the people” while he championed flattering coverage, such as the One America News Network (OAN) [485].

          1.2.1.4.1.2. Con:
          In a democracy, fake news exists [486], and President Trump should have been allowed to call out on what he perceived as fake news.

            1.2.1.4.1.2.1. Con:
            As the president of a democratic society, President Trump should have respected media freedom [487] and an independent, pluralistic media.

            1.2.1.4.1.2.2. Pro:
            Calling out fake news is better than living in an autocracy [488], with no news and no freedom of speech.

          1.2.1.4.1.3. Con:
          President Trump said that "fake news" was the enemy of the people [489]. He didn't call all media the enemy of the people.

            1.2.1.4.1.3.1. Pro:
            President Trump stated at a rally in Florida in 2018 that a third of Americans believed that fake news was "the enemy of the people [490]".

            1.2.1.4.1.3.2. Con:
            President Trump also stated that 'fake news' was any news about him that he disliked, disagreed with, or was otherwise negative about him. [491]

              1.2.1.4.1.3.2.1. Con:
              Fox News’s Chris Wallace [492], who received an award for excellence in journalism in 2017, stated that when President Trump talked "about bias in the media", he had a point.

              1.2.1.4.1.3.2.2. Pro:
              An organization or individual, belonging to the media, was only able to dodge the designation of "fake news" if they were in regular private communication with the president, to ensure their messaging was beneficial to President Trump. [493]

        1.2.1.4.2. Con:
        Press organizations that create sensational news to drive ratings [494] are not performing a public service.

        1.2.1.4.3. Pro:
        To paint all major media outlets with a broad brush is dangerously misguided.

          1.2.1.4.3.1. Pro:
          Not all news sources are equally good. Some have more professional staff and are less dependent on monetary incentives than others.

          1.2.1.4.3.2. Pro:
          Media outlets' can be biased [495] in both their content and coverage. They would push a narrative that supports a particular side or publish half-truth or otherwise unequivocally false, details on stories that would push either sides' narrative. This goes against the goal of any good media organization, which is to publish unbiased coverage and factual content.

          1.2.1.4.3.3. Pro:
          -> See 1.2.1.4.1.3.2.2.

        1.2.1.4.4. Con:
        Some news organizations presented biased content about President Trump and portrayed an unflattering depiction of him. He had the right to call out unfair content and coverage.

          1.2.1.4.4.1. Con:
          -> See 1.2.1.4.3.2.

          1.2.1.4.4.2. Con:
          The President does have a right to call out half-truth content, but to portray the publishers of factual stories, based on the narrative of their coverage, as "fake news" sets a dangerous precedent.

          1.2.1.4.4.3. Pro:
          Many mainstream sources pushed the narrative that the President called illegal/undocumented immigrants "animals".

            1.2.1.4.4.3.1. Con:
            President Trump was consistently careless (or deliberately ambiguous) with the objects of his accusations.

              1.2.1.4.4.3.1.1. Pro:
              Personal opinions are not what are asked of a president. His reasoning should be supported by evidences.

              1.2.1.4.4.3.1.2. Pro:
              While making an argument against immigration, he usually talked about MS-13 [496] and started to hurling insults using pronouns, which is a common tactic to bring emotional heat into a discussion.

            1.2.1.4.4.3.2. Pro:
            Many popular news sources [497] don't specify the context in their titles, in a day and age when most people skim the titles of the news and share without reading the article.

            1.2.1.4.4.3.3. Con:
            It is still unacceptable to call any person an animal regardless of context.

            1.2.1.4.4.3.4. Pro:
            This is an unfair depiction of the context of his discussion [498], because he was referring to individuals under that subset that are in-and-out of the US jail system, or repeat offenders.

            1.2.1.4.4.3.5. Con:
            It's not hard to draw parallels from President Trump referring to immigrants as "animals [499]" to Hitler calling Jews "vermin [500]" or the Hutus calling the Tutsis "cockroaches [501]" before those genocides. Even if Trump was using the term after MS-13 was mentioned, it's still a dangerous road to be on.

        1.2.1.4.5. Pro:
        The press is an important check on both federal and local governments, as indicated by the inclusion of freedom of the press in the First Amendment [502] to the US Constitution.

          1.2.1.4.5.1. Pro:
          The backbone of any democracy is an independent, professional and responsible media [503]. Their role is to inform, criticise and stimulate debate.

            1.2.1.4.5.1.1. Con:
            Not if they are creating news for channel ratings. CNN [504] got caught, but so many others reposted CNN's "news" as real [505] and never clarified which "news" was fake.

            1.2.1.4.5.1.2. Pro:
            Media and investigative reporting have an important role in deepening democracy (p. 1 [506]).

          1.2.1.4.5.2. Pro:
          Undermining the public's trust in the veracity and intentions of the press as a whole is an underhanded maneuver of censoring it.

          1.2.1.4.5.3. Con:
          Criticism is not the same as censorship.

            1.2.1.4.5.3.1. Con:
            When criticizing a group of people whose livelihoods have been built on their reputation for reporting factual information, censorship undermines the infrastructure of their industry and their bottom line. The media industry is built off of views and impressions of the content produced. When people don't trust you, they don't view your material. If this were to continue for much longer, it could systematically censor them by eliminating the means of producing the content they create.

        1.2.1.4.6. Con:
        It is the press that has undermined [507] the public's trust.

          1.2.1.4.6.1. Con:
          The verbal disparagement and threats [508] President Trump levied against the free press were dangerous and promoted unconstitutional suppression of the press.

            1.2.1.4.6.1.1. Pro:
            It should be the people's responsibility to be skeptical and seek the truth if they feel the mainstream media is being deceptive. The word of the President is a powerful thing; he should not have abused it.

            1.2.1.4.6.1.2. Con:
            President Trump created the Fake News Award [509] in 2018 to highlight misinformation provided by news outlets.

          1.2.1.4.6.2. Pro:
          Media news is mostly politically-driven.

            1.2.1.4.6.2.1. Con:
            Politics are important and the news media have an integral role in "informing marginalized segments of the population about politics [510]."

            1.2.1.4.6.2.2. Pro:
            Media coverage of Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil's current right-wing President, was in complete disregard of how his opposition destroyed [511] the country in the past mandates.

              1.2.1.4.6.2.2.1. Con:
              Giving politically-driven opinions is unavoidable in any media, and (so long as those opinions are supported by accurate and properly-represented evidence) entirely valid. To criticise Bolsonaro is a wholly seperate matter from supporting his opposition or disregarding their failings.

              1.2.1.4.6.2.2.2. Con:
              The second article linked says nothing about Bolsonaro's opposition destroying the country, and is itself widely critical of Bolsonaro.

          1.2.1.4.6.3. Pro:
          The press lost the public's trust without President Trump's help. He called out [512] the press for being biased and was proven correct [513].

            1.2.1.4.6.3.1. Pro:
            There has always been media bias [514] and "yellow journalism", therefore criticism is often warranted.

            1.2.1.4.6.3.2. Con:
            The tenuous relationship between the article and the claim explained that fake news was read and shared by both the right and the left, and it didn't seem to be 'primarily an issue of the uneducated' as some believed. Mostly it was just people reading things that they already supported and passing them on.

              1.2.1.4.6.3.2.1. Pro:
              The supporting source makes a mention of facts whose meaning is subject to interpretation, but the article makes no attempt to offer alternative interpretations.

                1.2.1.4.6.3.2.1.1. Pro:
                People working for Amazon give 90% of their donations to left leaning candidates, and 10% to right leaning candidates. The article implies this causes them to manipulate data towards the left. But they could be examining the data and moving to the left because of it.

              1.2.1.4.6.3.2.2. Pro:
              The article claimed that "put another way, socialist presidential candidate Bernie Sanders raked in nearly half again as much as both Republican presidential nominees. So claims that the social media giants are politically neutral were a joke."

                1.2.1.4.6.3.2.2.1. Pro:
                Sanders's campaign was structured [515] to encourage small donations from people so he didn't have to take money from PACS [516], unlike [517] the presidential nominees. The fact that more people donated to him was to be expected.

            1.2.1.4.6.3.3. Con:
            The cited articles are about social media, not about established media. The spread of fake news via social media is a problem, but the distrust of established media sources is partially due to the conflation of those sources with things that are seen on social media.

              1.2.1.4.6.3.3.1. Pro:
              It is the equivalent of saying that it's CNN's own fault that people don't trust it, because of the articles it published in the National Enquirer.

    1.2.2. Pro:
    An executive order [518] on preventing online censorship was released in May 2020.

      1.2.2.1. Pro:
      President Trump stated his willingness to prevent the online censorship of Twitter [519] as the platform had a tendency to selectively "place a warning label on certain tweets in a manner that clearly reflected political bias."

      1.2.2.2. Con:
      An order to prevent private companies from reducing the spread of misinformation is not a measure to protect "free speech" but a license to lie.

    1.2.3. Con:
    President Trump severely damaged the exercise of free speech [520].

      1.2.3.1. Pro:
      President Trump authorized the use of tear gas and rubber bullets on peaceful protesters [521] fighting for justice for George Floyd on the 1st of June 2020.

      1.2.3.2. Pro:
      These concerns about "free speech" often seem to focus more on protecting certain groups from any criticism [522] rather than protecting the right broadly for all groups, in all cases.

      1.2.3.3. Pro:
      President Trump's abuse of free speech left America more vulnerable to disasters [523].

    1.2.4. Con:
    President Trump used the rhetoric of hate [524] during his presidency.

      1.2.4.1. Pro:
      Much of the freedom President Trump advocated for opened the way for hate speech, racism, and toxic discourse.

        1.2.4.1.1. Pro:
        President Trump's senior campaign advisor and speechwriter used coded messages that referenced and allied with white supremacy [525], as shown by his leaked emails.

        1.2.4.1.2. Pro:
        President Trump called COVID-19 the "Chinese virus" and "Kung flu." [526]

        1.2.4.1.3. Con:
        President Trump was honest in his fight against "political correctness [527]".

        1.2.4.1.4. Con:
        The problem wasn't that President Trump advocated for freedom, but that there were elements in society that misused it.

      1.2.4.2. Con:
      Truly free speech allows people to openly voice any kind of opinion.

        1.2.4.2.1. Con:
        Free speech doesn't prohibit the consequences of abusing it.

        1.2.4.2.2. Con:
        According to the Supreme Court of the US, the First Amendment [528] does not protect certain types of speech [529], including incitement to lawless action, fighting words, and defamation, among others.

        1.2.4.2.3. Pro:
        Prohibiting specific opinions could lead to censorship [530].

      1.2.4.3. Pro:
      President Trump weaponized free speech [531].

    1.2.5. Pro:
    President Trump issued an executive order to protect campus free speech [532] in March 2019.

      1.2.5.1. Con:
      The order didn't actually protect free speech [533], instead, it gave the order to the Department of Education to provide more "granular information about student debt and earnings on the College Scorecard [534]."

      1.2.5.2. Pro:
      The aim of this order was to improve transparency on college campuses [535] by promoting free speech.

        1.2.6.2.1. Pro:

  1.3. Con:
  President Trump committed many immoral actions [543] - the character of a leader is of utmost importance.

    1.3.1. Con:
    According to voters [544], policies, rather than social actions are what determine whether a president is good.

      1.3.1.1. Pro:
      We don't judge Abe Lincoln by his personality, but rather the fact he "modernized the economy, gave strength to the federal government, and issued the Emancipation Proclamation". [545]

      1.3.1.2. Con:
      A president represents a society, therefore both policies and social actions are important.

      1.3.2.1. Con:

        1.3.2.1.1. Pro:
        President Trump failed to release his tax returns [548], giving lack of evidence otherwise.

      President Trump sought greater financial benefits in using his properties for government business [553].

    President Trump openly supported harmful conspiracy theories [554].

      1.3.3.1. Pro:

        1.3.3.3.1. Pro:

        These are long-range, unofficial diagnoses, thus are neither reliable, nor ethical.

        1.3.3.5.2. Con:
        None of these things, traits, or qualities automatically made him a bad president, nor precluded him from being a good president.

    1.3.4. Pro:
    President Trump's administration was unethical [564].

      1.3.4.1. Pro:
      President Trump lacked integrity and virtue [565], as evidenced by his penchant for lying [566].

        1.3.4.1.1. Con:

            1.3.4.1.1.1.2. Con:
            President Trump didn't care about human rights, as building a wall over the Mexican border would have been similar to the Berlin Wall [570].

              In terms of the economy and the deficit [575], this may prove to be a bad move in the long run.

              1.3.4.1.1.2.4.2. Con:
              This meant billions [576] of dollars in lost revenues and was not a fiscally responsible decision.

              Lowering the corporate tax rate [577] substantially below the top personal income tax rate can jeopardize the integrity of the tax system as high-income individuals will attempt to shelter their savings within corporations.

            President Trump promised to eliminate the federal debt "fairly quickly" in an interview with Sean Hannity [578]. Instead, the federal debt increased [579] by $3.1 trillion.

          Lying was a way for President Trump to exercise power [652].

        1.3.4.1.3. Pro:
        According to the Washington Post [653], President Trump made more than 22,000 false or misleading claims during his presidency.

          1.3.4.1.3.1. Pro:
          President Trump lied about COVID-19 [654].

            1.3.4.1.3.1.1. Pro:
            President Trump continuously downplayed the significance of COVID-19.

              1.3.4.1.3.1.1.1. Con:
              President Trump's reaction to the virus was mischaracterized by the media.

                1.3.4.1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro:
                According to President Trump, he had intentionally kept calm and tried not to cause panic, which the media wrongly labeled as him 'downplaying [655]' it.

                1.3.4.1.3.1.1.1.2. Pro:
                President Trump did not call the virus a hoax as portrayed by the media, rather called the Democrat over-reaction to the virus a hoax [656].

                1.3.4.1.3.1.1.1.3. Con:
                President Trump claimed multiple times that COVID-19 numbers were looking "much better, going down almost everywhere, [657]” and even “coming way down.”

                1.3.4.1.3.1.1.1.4. Con:
                President Trump used a misleading comparison between the outbreak and death rate for COVID-19 and that of H1N1 [658].

              1.3.4.1.3.1.1.2. Con:
              President Trump has always viewed COVID-9 seriously. He is famously reported to have stated, “I’ve always known this is a real—this is a pandemic. I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic … I’ve always viewed it as very serious. [659]”

            1.3.4.1.3.1.2. Pro:
            President Trump's lies about COVID-19 were dangerous [660] to public health.

              1.3.4.1.3.1.2.1. Pro:
              Twitter censured [661] President Trump in October 2020, after he falsely claimed that he was "immune" from COVID-19.

            1.3.4.1.3.1.3. Con:
            President Trump didn't lie, there was worldwide misinformation related to COVID-19 [662] at the beginning of the pandemic.

              1.3.4.1.3.1.3.1. Con:
              Relaying inaccurate and disputed information in his position as a public figure was tantamount to lying.

          1.3.4.1.3.2. Pro:
          He continued to insist his lies were true, thus undermining democracy [663].

          1.3.4.1.3.3. Pro:
          President Trump may well be a pathological liar, according to his own lawyers [664].

          1.3.4.1.3.4. Pro:
          The [665] Washington Post [666] tracked him at over 5000 lies [667] and misleading or false statements in the first 601 days of his presidency.

      1.3.4.2. Pro:
      According to a 2018 report from Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) [668], the former US President conflated "matters of public interest with decisions that 'benefit his bottom line'."

      1.3.4.3. Pro:
      Donald Trump spent more time golfing [669] during his presidency than a professional golfer.

      1.3.4.4. Pro:
      President Trump had a history of buying influence from politicians [670].

    1.3.5. Pro:
    President Trump did not support equality.

      1.3.5.1. Pro:
      Donald Trump is racist [671].

        1.3.5.1.1. Pro:
        President Trump made numerous derogatory remarks about Mexican people.

          1.3.5.1.1.1. Pro:
          President Trump referred to a federal judge hearing a case about Trump University as "biased" because of the judge’s Mexican heritage [672].

          1.3.5.1.1.2. Con:
          President Trump established the White House Hispanic Prosperity Initiative to help Hispanic Americans reach better education pathways [673], which showed his commitment with the Hispanic community.

          1.3.5.1.1.3. Pro:
          President Trump broadly referred to Mexican people as criminals.

            1.3.5.1.1.3.1. Pro:
            President Trump described a caravan of migrants traveling through Mexico as "criminals and unknown Middle Easterners [674]."

            1.3.5.1.1.3.2. Pro:
            President Trump broadly characterized Mexican immigrants as criminals, drug users, and rapists [675].

              1.3.5.1.1.3.2.1. Pro:
              Immigration is not correlated with criminality [676].

                1.3.5.1.1.3.2.1.1. Pro:
                It has been shown that undocumented immigrants are half as likely to be arrested for violent crimes as US-born citizens [677].

                1.3.5.1.1.3.2.1.2. Con:
                President Trump was referring to illegal immigration, which is by definition a criminal [678] activity.

                  1.3.5.1.1.3.2.1.2.1. Con:
                  Even if the statement referred to the crime of illegally entering the country, this does not explain the references to drugs and rape.

                  1.3.5.1.1.3.2.1.2.2. Pro:
                  Illegally entering the country is both a crime and a civil violation under US immigration laws [679].

              1.3.5.1.1.3.2.2. Con:
              President Trump was not referring to all Mexican immigrants; he explicitly stated that he assumed some of the immigrants were good people.

                1.3.5.1.1.3.2.2.1. Con:
                President Trump has been known to generalise about other incidents in the past too.

                  1.3.5.1.1.3.2.2.1.1. Con:
                  Generalising is not necessarily a bad thing.

                1.3.5.1.1.3.2.2.2. Pro:
                President Trump was expressly only talking about the subset of Mexicans who choose to illegally sneak into the US [680], saying that they were not the best Mexico had to offer. (p. 2)

                  1.3.5.1.1.3.2.2.2.1. Pro:
                  In 2019, 43% of the 11.6 million immigrants from Mexico [681] living in the US were in the country illegally.

                  1.3.5.1.1.3.2.2.2.2. Con:
                  To generalise any group - even passingly - as rapists is unacceptable [682].

        1.3.5.1.2. Pro:
        In light of the protests and counter-protests in Charlottesville [683], he tarred both sides with the same brush, equating the protesters of ANTIFA on the left, with White Supremacists and Neo-Nazis [684] on the right. This drew a lot of criticism of President Trump.

          1.3.5.1.2.1. Pro:
          The rally was organized by Richard Spencer [685], a white supremacist. The rally was white supremacist, antisemitic, white separatist, and neo-fascist.

            1.3.5.1.2.1.1. Pro:
            President Trump later amended his statement to say that there were "some fine, very fine people, on both sides [686]", again a sweeping generalisation.

              1.3.5.1.2.1.1.1. Pro:
              These comments were seen by critics as implying moral equivalence between the white supremacist marchers and those who protested against them.

              1.3.5.1.2.1.1.2. Pro:
              Although there were undoubtedly some innocent and/or peaceful protesters on the right, many of the marchers chanted racist and antisemitic slogans [687], carried semi-automatic rifles, swastikas, Nazi symbols etc. Because of this, many feel he has said there are "very fine" Neo-Nazis/Nazi sympathisers.

          1.3.5.1.2.2. Pro:
          In his first statement on the rally, President Trump did not denounce white nationalists explicitly, instead he condemned "hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides".

        1.3.5.1.3. Pro:
        President Trump was a racist landlord [688].

        1.3.5.1.4. Pro:
        President Trump called for the death of five innocent Black and Latino boys, known as the Central Park Five and begrudged them their settlement when they were proven innocent [689] years later.

      1.3.5.2. Pro:
      President Trump imposed restrictions on the LGBTQ+ community.

        1.3.5.2.1. Pro:
        President Trump banned transgender people from the military at great financial cost to the country [690].

        1.3.5.2.2. Pro:
        President Trump made it impossible for gay couples to adopt a child [691].

        1.3.5.2.3. Con:
        President Trump created an international campaign to decriminalize homosexuality [692].

        1.3.5.2.4. Pro:
        Trump's presidency and policies negatively affected the mental health [693] of many LGBTQ+ Americans.

        1.3.5.2.5. Con:
        President Trump appointed the first openly gay cabinet member [694] in US history.

      1.3.5.3. Pro:
      A bulk of evidence suggests that President Trump was sexist [695].

        1.3.5.3.1. Pro:
        An analysis of President Trump's discourse [696] and use of language suggests that Trump's sexist view is ingrained, and his belief of men being superior to women will not change.

          1.3.5.3.1.1. Pro:
          President Trump has a long history of offensive and sexist statements against women [697].

            1.3.5.3.1.1.1. Con:
            President Trump has apologized [698] for some of his comments about women.

            1.3.5.3.1.1.2. Pro:
            "I think the only difference between me and the other candidates is that I’m more honest and my women are more beautiful. [699]" - firstly, the 'honesty' is disputable, and secondly, women are not objects as suggested in this quote.

            1.3.5.3.1.1.3. Pro:
            President Trump told a mother who needed a break to use a breast pump that she was "disgusting [700]".

            1.3.5.3.1.1.4. Pro:
            Donald Trump implied in 2012 that he approved [701] of photographers secretly taking nude photographs of Kate Middleton.

          1.3.5.3.1.2. Con:
          In spite of this, many women voted [702] for Trump in both 2016 and 2020, implying that they didn't consider his sexism to be a deal-breaker.

          1.3.5.3.1.3. Pro:
          Donald Trump wrote [703] that "all of the women on The Apprentice flirted with me – consciously or unconsciously. That's to be expected." in 2004. This was both arrogant and demonstrated casual sexism.

        1.3.5.3.2. Con:
        President Trump recruited and promoted women [704] in his companies, which showed that he didn't think that men are superior to women.

        1.3.5.3.3. Con:
        President Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump, holds the same position [705]—executive vice president at The Trump Organization—as her two brothers, which contradicts the assertion that President Trump is sexist.

          1.3.5.3.3.1. Con:
          President Trump has said he would date his daughter [706].

            1.3.5.3.3.1.1. Pro:
            President Trump didn't seem to have a moral compass as he also joked about having sex with his daughter [707].

              1.3.5.3.3.1.1.1. Pro:
              In an interview with Rolling Stone [708], he stated his sexual attraction towards his daughter by saying: “Yeah, she’s really something, and what a beauty, that one. If I weren’t happily married and, ya know, her father."

            1.3.5.3.3.1.2. Con:
            President Trump's representatives clarified that these statements from the president were intended to be a joke [709].

          1.3.5.3.3.2. Con:
          Being sexist does not require someone to be prejudiced against all women.

          1.3.5.3.3.3. Con:
          Donald Trump has made inappropriate comments [710] about Ivanka's appearance.

          1.3.5.3.3.4. Pro:
          Ivanka Trump supported feminist agendas [711] and encouraged her father [712] to pursue more progressive policies. That President Trump kept her in a position of influence could be seen as evidence of his willingness to consider gender equality measures.

        1.3.5.3.4. Pro:
        He had archaic views on abortion; while being anti-abortion is valid, his belief that there should be 'punishment' for women who have an abortion was deeply problematic - so much so that it caused him to retract [713] the statement in 2016.

          1.3.5.3.4.1. Pro:
          He also had a hypocritical view on abortion because he used an antibody treatment that was tested using cells originally derived from an abortion [714].

        1.3.5.3.5. Pro:
        President Trump selected Brett Kavanaugh [715], a transparently partisan individual accused of rape and perjury, for the Supreme Court.

          1.3.5.3.5.1. Con:
          The accusations against Kavanaugh were flimsy and likely fabricated.

            1.3.5.3.5.1.1. Con:
            Kavanaugh's sexual misconduct allegations [716] led to new reporting in 2019, which led to calls for Kavanaugh’s impeachment.

            1.3.5.3.5.1.2. Pro:
            Julie Swetnick's accusation lacked corroboration. She changed her story [717], had a less than stellar legal history [718], and had several people who knew her and attested to her untrustworthy character. [719]

              1.3.5.3.5.1.2.1. Con:
              Swetnick's affidavit "adds credibility to the image of Kavanaugh [720]" painted by the other women who accused him of sexual misconduct.

              1.3.5.3.5.1.2.2. Pro:
              Swetnick was referred to the Justice Department [721] in 2018.

          1.3.5.3.5.2. Pro:
          It seems very plausible [722] that Kavanaugh committed perjury.

            1.3.5.3.5.2.1. Con:
            It is possible that Kavanaugh's legal team were the ones involved in the text messages. Without the texts themselves, it is not clear either way.

            1.3.5.3.5.2.2. Con:
            In regards to the question of text messages in relation to Ramirez's accusation, Kavanaugh may have heard of the incoming accusation, even if he had no certainty it would emerge or knowledge of details. Kavanaugh could have interpreted the question of when he first heard of the accusations as when he had heard of the details.

              1.3.5.3.5.2.2.1. Con:
              His claims to not know her outside of University however were shown to be false. They were bridesmaid and Groomsman at a wedding together and are pictured together in a photo.

            1.3.5.3.5.2.3. Con:
            On the subject of drinking, Kavanaugh admitted to drinking too much, but claimed never to have "blacked out" [723], referring to an alcohol-induced period of amnesia. Whether he experienced a black out is almost entirely a case of his own state of mind, and so impossible to prove.

              1.3.5.3.5.2.3.1. Con:
              Kavanaugh claimed that he never drank while underage [724], but the legal drinking age at the time was 21, and he was 18.

              1.3.5.3.5.2.3.2. Con:
              He carefully qualified that he never blacked out from drinking beer, and evasively never acknowledged or denied a possibility of blacking out from liquor, wine, or any other intoxicant.

            1.3.5.3.5.2.4. Con:
            In terms of the yearbook slang, despite modern definitions differing from Kavanaugh's account, we had evidence that boof can refer to flatulence [725], we have a testimony and other yearbook entries that refer to FFFFF as an inside joke and devil's triangle as a game.

              1.3.5.3.5.2.4.1. Con:
              We also have testimony from some of his other "friends" and classmates that he lied about these definitions, the same with Rentate Alumnus.

            1.3.5.3.5.2.5. Con:
            In the case of the stolen Democratic emails, this is a question of a state of mind. If Kavanaugh claimed that he did not notice their origins, proof is required. Perhaps a documented reference to the stolen emails as stolen would suffice, but none have appeared. As such, this does not meet the grounds for perjury.

            1.3.5.3.5.2.6. Pro:
            He claimed that he didn't have time for parties and never attended any. His own calendar shows at least 2, if not 3 in that one month.

            1.3.5.3.5.2.7. Pro:
            Justice Kavanaugh clearly committed perjury when explaining the meaning of a Devil's Triangle [726] while under oath during the Senate hearing of his nomination.

    1.3.6. Pro:
    President Trump and his associates were connected to a host of crimes.

      1.3.6.1. Con:
      Every accusation against President Trump was 'alleged' and nothing was proven in court or otherwise.

        1.3.6.1.1. Con:
        Even if nothing was proven against President Trump, many of his close associates [727] were found guilty of serious crimes, including conspiracy to defraud the US.

          1.3.6.1.1.1. Pro:
          Robert Stone [728], Michael Cohen [729], George Papadopoulos [730], and Paul Manafort [731] were found guilty of crimes.

          1.3.6.1.1.2. Con:
          The fact that his associates committed crimes doesn't prove that President Trump participated in those crimes.

            1.3.6.1.1.2.1. Con:
            It does, however, raise questions about President Trump's possible knowledge of and deliberate ignorance of these crimes.

        1.3.6.1.2. Con:
        It is unlikely that a US president can face criminal prosecution in court [732].

      1.3.6.2. Pro:
      Revelations published in January 2021, show that President Trump engaged in a criminal conspiracy [733].

        1.3.6.2.1. Pro:
        President Trump also engaged in a coverup of that conspiracy, to smear his political opponent Joe Biden in 2019 [734].

          1.3.6.2.1.1. Pro:
          This was done by extorting the government of Ukraine through illegally withholding [735] congressionally approved aid unless President Trump's demands were met.

          1.3.6.2.1.2. Con:
          President Trump stated that he only discussed political rival Joe Biden with the president of Ukraine [736] during a phone call.

        1.3.6.2.2. Con:
        President Trump was acquitted by the Senate [737] following the impeachment on charges of abusing the power of his office and obstructing Congress.

      1.3.6.3. Pro:
      President Trump was involved in the obstruction of justice [738], as described in the Muller Report [739] submitted in March 2019.

        1.3.6.3.1. Pro:
        The report included allegations of conspiracy and coordination between President Trump and Russia [740].

          1.3.6.3.1.1. Pro:
          The Moscow Project analyzed and found a long history of business deals between President Trump and Putin [741].

            1.3.6.3.1.1.1. Con:
            President Trump was a businessman dealing with many countries. Business deals with a country are not suspicious.

            1.3.6.3.1.1.2. Con:
            The Moscow Project [742] is an aggressively anti-Trump group.

          1.3.6.3.1.2. Con:
          The FBI concluded that there was no clear connection between President Trump and Russia [743].

        1.3.6.3.2. Pro:
        Robert Muller’s investigation [744] identified 10 instances of possible obstruction of justice.

          1.3.6.3.2.1. Pro:
          In March 2019, the investigation resulted in dozens of indictments [745] for federal crimes, and at least eight guilty pleas, or convictions.

          1.3.6.3.2.2. Pro:
          More than 1000 former federal prosecutors [746] agreed that President Trump’s conduct, had he had been a private citizen, would have resulted in multiple felony charges.

        1.3.6.3.3. Con:
        President Trump called the Muller report the “greatest Political Crime in the History of the US, the Russian Witch-Hunt [747].”

        1.3.6.3.4. Con:
        The Muller report didn't find enough evidence of the link between President Trump and Russia [748], and left the question of obstruction of justice open.

      1.3.6.4. Pro:
      President Trump has been involved in various financial crimes.

        1.3.6.4.1. Pro:
        President Trump paid $25 million [749] to settle with students he defrauded at the now-defunct Trump University.

          1.3.6.4.1.1. Pro:
          President Trump scammed thousands of people with his Trump University [750].

        1.3.6.4.2. Pro:
        President Trump paid $2 million in fines for misusing charity funds. [751]

        1.3.6.4.3. Con:
        Even if President Trump might have been involved in financial crimes, as president of the US he had protection from legal action [752], and therefore the crimes weren't proven.

        1.3.6.4.4. Pro:
        President Trump evaded hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes [753].

        1.3.6.4.5. Pro:
        President Trump violated the US Constitution's foreign emoluments clause [754] by earning foreign revenue [755] via his businesses.

          1.3.6.4.5.1. Con:
          Generating revenue by your business is not considered a gift, emolument, office, or title from foreign states, therefore it was not in violation of the Title of Nobility Clause [756].

            1.3.6.4.5.1.1. Con:
            Simply generating revenue is not the issue. It is the revenue received due in part to being US President which afforded foreign countries a favor. [757]

          1.3.6.4.5.2. Pro:
          President Trump profited from his presidency [758], which is a violation of the Emoluments Clause.

          1.3.6.4.5.3. Pro:
          In respect to the emoluments clause, President Trump unconstitutionally accepted payments from foreign and domestic governments [759].

      1.3.6.5. Pro:
      Many sexual assault allegations [760] were made against President Trump.

        1.3.6.5.1. Pro:
        President Trump has been accused of rape [761].

          1.3.6.5.1.1. Con:
          Accusations are not proven. You cannot judge a "potential predator" as though he's an actual predator.

        1.3.6.5.2. Con:
        None of these allegations have been proven.

        1.3.6.5.3. Pro:
        Dozens of women made allegations of sexual misconduct [762] against President Trump.

          1.3.6.5.3.1. Pro:
          At least 26 women have accused [763] President Trump of sexually harassing or assaulting them.

          1.3.6.5.3.2. Pro:
          A book called "All the President's Women: Donald Trump and the making of a predator [764]" detailed full 26 incidents of “unwanted sexual contact” and 43 instances of inappropriate behavior.

            1.3.6.5.3.2.1. Pro:
            According to The Guardian [765], "the list of women who have publicly made sexual misconduct allegations against Donald Trump outnumbers the list of officials in his cabinet."

            1.3.6.5.3.2.2. Con:
            President Trump denied these harassment allegations and claimed they were "motivated by attempts to sell [766]" the book.

        1.3.6.5.4. Con:
        President Trump has denied [767] all allegations of sexual assault.

        1.3.6.5.5. Pro:
        President Trump has been accused of grabbing women's genitals [768] without their consent.

  1.4. Pro:
  President Trump improved the US during his presidency.

    1.4.1. Pro:
    President Trump improved the US economy [769].

      1.4.1.1. Con:
      President Trump's economic policies were only intended to benefit himself, his administrators, and elite interests [770].

      1.4.1.2. Con:
      -> See 1.1.7.4.3.1.1.1.

      1.4.1.3. Pro:
      President Trump pushed through a revolutionary tax reform [771].

        1.4.1.3.1. Pro:
        President Trump's tax reforms stretched [772] tax brackets and reduced taxes on the middle class.

          1.4.1.3.1.1. Con:
          The long-term effects of the tax cut were already costing the US $2.3 trillion [773] in 2018.

          1.4.1.3.1.2. Pro:
          The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) reduced "statutory tax rates at almost all levels of taxable income [774]," together with a shift in the thresholds for several income tax brackets.

          1.4.1.3.1.3. Con:
          Individual and family taxes will expire in 2025, while the law created a permanent single corporate tax rate of 21% [775].

        1.4.1.3.2. Pro:
        The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was considered the largest overhaul of the tax code in three decades [776].

          1.4.1.3.2.1. Pro:
          -> See 1.4.1.3.1.2.

        1.4.1.3.3. Con:
        The Tax Reform was of undetermined value - although 37/38 economists thought it was terrible, and the 38th misread the question [777].

          1.4.1.3.3.1. Pro:
          It was vital to canvass opinions from experts in the field [778], given that President Trump was not an economist and every new measure [779] seemed likely to worsen America's financial situation.

          1.4.1.3.3.2. Con:
          The economy was booming [780] after the tax cut legislation, suggesting that these economists have zero predictive power.

        1.4.1.3.4. Con:
        The tax cut boosted the Federal deficit to trillion-dollars [781], on top of the already high deficits imposed by the previous administration to counter the 2008 financial crash and recession.

        1.4.1.3.5. Pro:
        There are additional benefits to people that may flow from longer-term macroeconomic factors, commonly known as 'trickle-down [782]' economics.

          1.4.1.3.5.1. Con:
          Ample research [783] and examples [784] have shown [785] that trickle down economics do not often work [786] as intended.

            1.4.1.3.5.1.1. Con:
            The economy was booming [787] in 2018, suggesting all of those sources are irrelevant.

              1.4.1.3.5.1.1.1. Pro:
              The US economy grew 2.9% In 2018 [788].

              1.4.1.3.5.1.1.2. Con:
              Particular segments of the economy were booming, but growing household debt [789], growing income inequality [790], and increased cost of living [791] are not a good kind of boom.

              1.4.1.3.5.1.1.3. Con:
              This is a post hoc ergo propter hoc [792] fallacy. Simply because there have been positive economic occurrences during the Trump presidency does not mean that he caused them.

                1.4.1.3.5.1.1.3.1. Pro:
                Many of the metrics [793] are the same as 2019 being the biggest year on record. All economic metrics continued the same trend that were in place from his predecessor. Except the Dow, which was negative in 2018 after huge growth.

                1.4.1.3.5.1.1.3.2. Pro:
                Evidence shows [794] these economic occurrences to be a continuation of long-term trends [795] that pre-date him.

              1.4.1.3.5.1.1.4. Con:
              The 2018 upward trend in the economy and employment was already a reality before President Trump took office [796].

                1.4.1.3.5.1.1.4.1. Pro:
                This was in spite of President Trump, not because of him [797]. It was growing along the same basic trajectory [798] as before he took office.

                1.4.1.3.5.1.1.4.2. Con:
                Median family income [799] soared under President Trump's administration.

                1.4.1.3.5.1.1.4.3. Pro:
                -> See 1.1.7.4.3.1.1.1.2.

            1.4.1.3.5.1.2. Pro:
            The theory of trickle-down economics doesn't work [800], as cutting the top tax rate does not lead to economic growth [801].

            1.4.1.3.5.1.3. Pro:
            Supply-side economics result in greater income inequality [802].

            1.4.1.3.5.1.4. Pro:
            The rise of national and local costs of living [803] as well as natural currency inflation [804] increases at a faster and steeper rate [805] than the rate at which funds can trickle [806] from higher socio-economic levels to lower ones.

          1.4.1.3.5.2. Pro:
          According to the trickle-down theory [807], if the richest increase their wealth, they will spend a proportion of this extra wealth, which will cause more demand for goods and services and higher employment.

        1.4.1.3.6. Con:
        The tax cuts primarily benefit [808] the owners of capital via the businesses they own. In total dollar terms, only a marginal portion of the tax cuts benefited the so-called ‘hard-working Americans’.

        1.4.1.3.7. Pro:
        The executive branch under President Trump slashed a number of bloated regulations [809]. At last count for the financial year of 2018, 47 regulations were cut, and 10 new regulations were created, which resulted in savings of over $621.5M in taxpayer money.

          1.4.1.3.7.1. Con:
          It is still very unclear if this was a good thing or not. The overall savings weren't very high at $8 billion, while the cost was harder to quantify as some of the deregulatory actions and the blocking of new regulations may have put lives in jeopardy as a result. [810]

      1.4.1.4. Con:
      President Trump's weak public health and economic response [811] to the pandemic caused great financial harm to the country.

        1.4.1.4.1. Con:
        COVID-19 created a recession in the global economy [812], independently of President Trump's weak responses.

          1.4.1.4.1.1. Con:
          The US economy powers the world's economy due to its unmatched size.

            1.4.1.4.1.1.1. Pro:
            The US spends trillions of dollars [813] annually in global international trade.

        1.4.1.4.2. Pro:
        President Trump’s loose fiscal policy before the pandemic left America with much higher debt when entering into the crisis [814].

      1.4.1.5. Pro:
      President Trump enacted corporate tax reform [815].

        1.4.1.5.1. Con:
        President Trump said his tax policies would result in much faster growth, as high as 6%. GDP grew [816] 2.4% in 2017, 2.9% in 2018 and through the 3rd quarter of 2019, average growth was just 2.3%.

        1.4.1.5.2. Pro:
        -> See 1.3.4.1.1.2.4.

        1.4.1.5.3. Pro:
        The corporate tax reform was needed to allow US manufacturers to compete [817] on a global stage, with tax rates more on par with other nation's tax rates [818].

        1.4.1.5.4. Con:
        President Trump's tax reforms helped the mega-rich [819] of America get away with paying less in taxes than the working class.

      1.4.1.6. Con:
      In November 2020, the US economy had the biggest economic contraction [820] ever recorded and the highest unemployment rate in more than 80 years.

        1.4.1.6.1. Pro:
        The national debt soared to almost $23 trillion [821] and the total debt over $74 trillion under his presidency.

        1.4.1.6.2. Pro:
        The US unemployment rate [822] for April 2020 was 14.7%, which was the highest since 1948.

          1.4.1.6.2.1. Pro:
          An estimated 300,000 US jobs were lost because of President Trump's trade war with China [823].

          1.4.1.6.2.2. Con:
          The US unemployment rate for February 2020 was 3.5% [824] according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Conflating unemployment because of the pandemic with unemployment as a product of President Trump's economy is a fallacy. Since April 2020, it has dropped to 7.9% [825].

        1.4.1.6.3. Con:
        The "economic contraction" was a product of the COVID-19 pandemic, not a product of Trump's economic policies. Before the pandemic hit, the US unemployment rate was 3.5% [826], the lowest in the last two decades.

          1.4.1.6.3.1. Con:
          The economy cannot prosper if the President fails to address threats to national security. Policies that outwardly are not economic in nature are linked to the economy.

      1.4.1.7. Con:
      President Trump didn't help the US economy. He inherited a strong economy from Obama's administration [827].

      1.4.1.8. Con:
      Overall, President Trump's policies increased economic inequality [828].

      1.4.1.9. Pro:
      The American economy was experiencing 4.2% [829] GDP growth in 2018, which contrasted positively against the recession predicted [830] by some economists.

        1.4.1.9.1. Con:
        The economy has been booming [831] since 2010, while the tax plan was passed at the end of 2017 [832]. Inflation, however, accelerated [833] since Trump became President.

        1.4.1.9.2. Pro:
        -> See 1.4.1.3.3.2.

      1.4.1.10. Pro:
      US small business optimism hit its highest level in history [834] under President Trump.

        1.4.1.10.1. Con:
        That is not proof of any policy success. The index is provided by the NFIB [835], which surveys only a small fraction of its members, which represent only about 10% (300k of 30 million) of small businesses in the nation, and is backed by and lobbies for large corporate interests.

        1.4.1.10.2. Pro:
        Consumer confidence surged to an 18 year high [836] in 2018.

          1.4.1.10.2.1. Con:
          The article cited is two years old. Because of President Trump's failure, millions of Americans [837] are still out of work, and others anticipate losing their homes [838]. In light of this, consumer confidence considerably reduced, and is likely to stay that way [839] for a while.

        1.4.1.10.3. Pro:
        America’s biggest companies reported [840] some of their strongest earnings growth since the recession under Trump's presidency.

      1.4.1.11. Pro:
      The US experienced historically low unemployment under President Trump.

        1.4.1.11.1. Con:
        The trend was present in the previous administration as well. [841] There is no reason to believe that President Trump's policies had anything to do with it.

          1.4.1.11.1.1. Con:
          President Trump created 6.6 million jobs in his first three years.

          1.4.1.11.1.2. Pro:
          This chart [842] shows what the unemployment numbers actually are. They have fallen about one percentage point each year since 2011, this trend was continuing until COVID-19.

          1.4.1.11.1.3. Pro:
          Economic indicators do not necessarily prove that a president is doing well. The president cannot directly control and manipulate the American economy and cannot be considered entirely responsible for its success or failure.

            1.4.1.11.1.3.1. Con:
            Certain indicators like the incentive to be reelected result in an increase in presidential effort on GDP growth [843].

              1.4.1.11.1.3.1.1. Con:
              Economic arguments for the success of a president are based as much on partisanship as they are on data [844].

            1.4.1.11.1.3.2. Pro:
            The President's claim of job creation as evidence of his success was overstated. Job growth continued on the trend in Obama's second term [845], albeit at a slower pace.

              1.4.1.11.1.3.2.1. Pro:
              According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics [846], job growth in 2017 was lower than past four years.

                1.4.1.11.1.3.2.1.1. Pro:
                2018's growth of 208k jobs (through Sept), was lower than 2015 and 2016. If the President's claim was that his tax cuts created jobs, it was not evident in job numbers.

              1.4.1.11.1.3.2.2. Pro:
              Unemployment rates were at record lows [847] in many other countries as a result of a long global expansion that followed the financial crisis in 2008.

                1.4.1.11.1.3.2.2.1. Pro:
                Many of these countries had policies directly contrary to the President's. Thirty-six countries had rates lower than the USA, including Japan (2.4%), Germany (3.4%), Mexico (3.4%), Poland (3.5%), and Hungary (3.6%).

        1.4.1.11.2. Pro:
        Black and Hispanic [848] unemployment rates were historically low [849] in 2018 and 2019.

          1.4.1.11.2.1. Con:
          This was more a result of Obama's policies than Trump's [850].

          1.4.1.11.2.2. Pro:
          In September 2019, unemployment among African Americans reached a record low rate of 5.5% [851].

        1.4.1.11.3. Pro:
        President Trump claimed that female unemployment in 2018 was at the lowest rate in 65 years [852].

          1.4.1.11.3.1. Pro:
          The unemployment rate for US women fell to 3.6% [853] in 2018.

          1.4.1.11.3.2. Con:
          This claim is considered a misleading talking point by independent analysts; if 863,000 women joined the workforce during the first 11 months of Trump's presidency, it would represent 34% less [854] compared with the period from January to December during each of the previous two years.

        1.4.1.11.4. Con:
        Even assuming that lower unemployment was a result of President Trump's [855] actions during his time in office, wealth inequality [856] was increasing [857], and wages [858] remained stagnant when adjusted for inflation.

          1.4.1.11.4.1. Pro:
          It is also important to take into account whether the new jobs created provided liveable wages [859]. A stronger economy ought to mean real benefits for average families, not just those at the top.

        1.4.1.11.5. Pro:
        In 2018, the unemployment rate was at its lowest in 50 years [860], when it dropped to 3.7%.

          1.4.1.11.5.1. Con:
          The trend towards low unemployment [861] has been following a relatively unchanged curve for 10 years (far longer than Trump's presidency), and if anything, that curve only shallowed since President Trump took office.

          1.4.1.11.5.2. Pro:
          After the 2020 increase due to COVID-19, the rate of unemployment dropped from 14.7% (April) to 13.3% [862] (June 2020).

    1.4.2. Con:
    President Trump sowed greater polarization [863] and division among Americans [864].

      1.4.2.1. Pro:
      President Trump used identity politics [865] to further divide American communities.

        1.4.2.1.1. Con:
        The liberal mainstream media uses gender identity politics [866] to divide our communities. President Trump rejected gender identity politics.

          1.4.2.1.1.1. Con:
          The media may report on gender identity politics but President Trump used it on purpose.

            1.4.2.1.1.1.1. Pro:
            President Trump used identity politics when he pledged to nominate a woman [867] to the Supreme Court to fill the seat of judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

            1.4.2.1.1.1.2. Con:
            President Trump criticized identity politics for influencing US history studies and for "fostering resentment by trying to divide people [868]".

          1.4.2.1.1.2. Pro:
          Biased journalism [869] plays an important role on identity politics and the division in the US.

        1.4.2.1.2. Pro:
        President Trump implemented laws in order to ease and allow discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community [870].

          1.4.2.1.2.1. Pro:
          -> See 1.3.5.2.1.

        1.4.2.1.3. Pro:
        President Trump divided his supporters and peaceful protesters by calling the protesters bad people [871] and suggesting that they were not like his fans.

        1.4.2.1.4. Pro:
        By playing identity politics and picking a definitive side on hundreds of controversial topics, President Trump created many small groups of "us" vs "them" [872].

          1.4.2.1.4.1. Pro:
          President Trump constantly repeated buzzwords and phrases [873] that were widely used by various hate groups to inspire enmity against a wide array of minority groups.

            1.4.2.1.4.1.1. Pro:
            He defiles the identity of others [874] and slanders entire religions [875] as s***holes [876] populated by drug-dealers, criminals and rapists [877].

            1.4.2.1.4.1.2. Pro:
            This ancient practice [878], including ad hominem [879] attacks, appeals to the worst and most base feelings within the stressed and distressed, building a wide base of blind, nonthinking and unwavering supporters.

          1.4.2.1.4.2. Con:
          President Trump set a common enemy for his people to motivate them and unite the country.

            1.4.2.1.4.2.1. Con:
            It is a common tool and theme of fascism, exactly what the Nazi party did [880] with the Jews and other European powers in the wake of World War I and run-up to World War II.

      1.4.2.2. Pro:
      President Trump intensified racial inequality [881] in the US.

        1.4.2.2.1. Pro:
        In 2019, 56% of Americans [882] said that President Trump had worsened race relations in the US.

          1.4.2.2.1.1. Pro:
          According to the majority of Americans, President Trump Increased US racial tensions after George Floyd's death [883].

          1.4.2.2.1.2. Con:
          President Trump was supported by several minority groups [884] in the 2020 election.

            1.4.2.2.1.2.1. Pro:
            President Trump won certain states thanks to black voters [885].

              1.4.2.2.1.2.1.1. Con:
              According to the AP Votecast, only 8% of black voters voted for President Trump [886].

              1.4.2.2.1.2.1.2. Con:
              President Trump failed to implement a $500 billion investment (Platinum Plan) [887] in the black community as he promised.

              1.4.2.2.1.2.1.3. Con:
              Many of the perceived benefits the black community thought happened because of President Trump, were not the result of his policies, but the continuation of increasing prosperity driven largely by rising minimum wages at the state and local levels [888], as well as a more competitive labor market [889].

            1.4.2.2.1.2.2. Pro:
            President Trump's Latino support [890] grew in the 2020 election.

        1.4.2.2.2. Con:
        Racial inequalities [891] are rooted in US history.

          1.4.2.2.2.1. Pro:
          African Americans have protested against racist policing and legal and extra-legal discrimination since the post-Civil War days in the 1870s [892].

    1.4.3. Con:
    President Trump harmed international views of America [893], diminishing its standing and prestige in the eyes of the world.

      1.4.3.1. Pro:
      President Trump often contradicted himself, or outright lied.

        1.4.3.1.1. Con:
        It was only polarising because so many people were very biased. That was not President Trump's fault.

          1.4.3.1.1.1. Con:
          That argument would take the whole responsibility from President Trump to load it just on the citizens.

            1.4.3.1.1.1.1. Pro:
            "People are biased" is a knockout-argument, you could add it everywhere where people are criticised for their behaviour.

            1.4.3.1.1.1.2. Con:
            The fault is probably primarily that of the media, which has discovered that fomenting partisan conflict and outrage [894] increases revenue.

          1.4.3.1.1.2. Con:
          It was President Trump's fault. Posting [895] 500 insults publicly on Twitter, several hundred within his first 3 months in office, was very polarizing.

        1.4.3.1.2. Con:
        It is better to have a president that either makes surface-level mistakes or tells extremely trivial lies than a president who intentionally tells meaningful lies to the American people.

        1.4.3.1.3. Pro:
        -> See 1.3.4.1.3.

        1.4.3.1.4. Pro:
        President Trump always seemed to pivot on his views.

          1.4.3.1.4.1. Pro:
          During the campaign, he described Ben Carson as a very, very special person, although he had previously compared the other candidate to a child molester [896].

            1.4.3.1.4.1.1. Con:
            This may have been because President Trump was initially running for office against Ben Carson [897], and then, having won, he actively reached out to mend bridges and form an alliance with his former opponent.

        1.4.3.1.5. Pro:
        President Trump lacked credibility on the world stage due in part to his frequent and transparent use of weak, unsound, and fallacious arguments. [898]

      1.4.3.2. Con:
      President Trump created a positive image of America in some areas that have traditionally shown derision and hatred towards the US, like North Korea [899].

        1.4.3.2.1. Con:
        While there were multiple summits, nothing ultimately came of them, and there is no evidence that any lasting positive image or relationship was created [900].

      1.4.3.3. Pro:
      President Trump was extremely uneducated, to the point that it was embarrassing.

        1.4.3.3.1. Pro:
        President Trump made silly mistakes when talking about history.

          1.4.3.3.1.1. Pro:
          At a Black History Month event, President Trump commented, “Frederick Douglass is an example of somebody who’s done an amazing job and is getting recognized more and more, I notice [901].” Douglass died in 1895.

            1.4.3.3.1.1.1. Con:
            Dead people can gain more recognition for their past acts. By definition, recognition of someone's actions merely needs to happen anytime after those actions have been committed. As another example, many artists are not recognized at all until after their death.

          1.4.3.3.1.2. Pro:
          President Trump suggested that the Civil War might have been prevented if Andrew Jackson had been involved [902]. Jackson couldn't have prevented the Civil War, because he died 16 years before the war started [903].

            1.4.3.3.1.2.1. Con:
            President Trump's actual quote in the New York Times, "I mean had Andrew Jackson been a little later you wouldn’t have had the Civil War [904]", does not indicate that he thought Andrew Jackson was alive during the Civil War.

        1.4.3.3.2. Pro:
        President Trump suggested that injecting disinfectants [905] would treat COVID-19.

          1.4.3.3.2.1. Con:
          Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) [906] (also known as lung washing) is a diagnostic method of the lower respiratory system in which a bronchoscope [907] is passed through the mouth or nose into the lungs [908]. It has even been used therapeutically to remove mucus, improve airway ventilation, and reduce airway inflammation in conditions such as COPD and PAP. Therefore, suggesting that doctors try injecting fluids into the lungs for cleaning wasn't a completely ridiculous idea.

          1.4.3.3.2.2. Pro:
          After President Trump's suggestion in April 2020, the state of Maryland's emergency hotline [909] received hundreds of calls from people seeking guidance about Trump's comments.

        1.4.3.3.3. Con:
        President Trump graduated with a degree in economics from the University of Pennsylvania [910].

        1.4.3.3.4. Con:
        A president's level of education is not necessarily indicative of their performance in the role.

          1.4.3.3.4.1. Con:
          Having a certain level of education helps Presidents build better policies.

            1.4.3.3.4.1.1. Pro:
            If a President has a strong understanding of history via their education, they will be able to construct better policies built on the knowledge the past has to offer [911].

          1.4.3.3.4.2. Pro:
          A good president is defined by the ability to successfully uphold the ideals of the people and implement policies through Congress, rather than by their education.

        1.4.3.3.5. Pro:
        By repeatedly making inaccurate claims, President Trump has made America a joke across the globe.

      1.4.3.4. Con:
      President Trump's ferocious fighting style was good for the public image of the US.

        1.4.3.4.1. Pro:
        President Trump showed a tough, aggressive attitude towards injustice and pressure from other countries.

          1.4.3.4.1.1. Pro:
          Without the help of President Trump [912], the EU could not have faced the on-going imperialism of the Chinese communist government.

            1.4.3.4.1.1.1. Con:
            The notion that China is acting in an imperialist fashion is heavily contested [913].

      1.4.3.5. Con:
      Confidence in President Trump was low internationally, but the views of the US were still relatively favorable [914].

        1.4.3.5.1. Con:
        Confidence in President Trump increased in many nations around the world, especially on the ideological right [915].

        1.4.3.5.2. Pro:
        International views of the US in 2019 were over 50% favorable [916].

        1.4.3.5.3. Con:
        Favourability of the US rose from 34% to 62% [917] after President Trump left office.

      1.4.3.6. Pro:
      President Trump's antics and behavior were unbecoming of a president, and as a result, global respect and admiration for US leadership had never been lower. [918]

        1.4.3.6.1. Pro:
        The US is less respected and less influential than it has been in decades [919].

        1.4.3.6.2. Pro:
        President Trump consistently created a bad image of America and its citizens by tweeting unpresidential statements.

          1.4.3.6.2.1. Con:
          The 'storm' was created by the media frenzy, not the tweet itself. The bias of the media [920] necessitated direct communication with the electorate and the world.

            1.4.3.6.2.1.1. Con:
            Many of his tweets [921] were offensive, grammatically questionable and/or plain bizarre.

              1.4.3.6.2.1.1.1. Pro:
              The media and President Trump himself are both responsible for the "Trump cloud." Trump is less presidential in behavior than preceding presidents, but on the other hand, the media is more fired up and prone to exaggeration than ever. This is a more plausible explanation than only making just one of these two responsible.

            1.4.3.6.2.1.2. Pro:
            The press is controlled by a few people [922] that can dictate what gets published.

              1.4.3.6.2.1.2.1. Con:
              The US has many large national independent newspapers [923], and the White House press corps represents many more national and international news sources. [924]

              1.4.3.6.2.1.2.2. Con:
              By far, the most damning international reportage of President Trump's lies and failings was his [925] own [926] Twitter feed [927].

            1.4.3.6.2.1.3. Pro:
            President Trump illuminated the bias of media, so Americans could make more informed decisions about the information they were using.

            1.4.3.6.2.1.4. Con:
            A tweetstorm [928] is a series of related tweets posted by a Twitter user in quick succession. Nobody in the press or elsewhere made President Trump do that.

              1.4.3.6.2.1.4.1. Pro:
              The 'storm' is created [929] by the sheer number of people and organizations he has personally attacked and alienated.

              1.4.3.6.2.1.4.2. Pro:
              President Trump often tweeted what he saw on Fox News [930] or his Twitter feed. That was what created the storm as one would hope that the president would have better sources of information.

          1.4.3.6.2.2. Con:
          Twitter is not a reflection of the US or the rest of the world.

            1.4.3.6.2.2.1. Con:
            Any form of communication the president uses is a reflection on the US.

          1.4.3.6.2.3. Con:
          The idea of what is presidential is open to change. A modern transparent president who speaks directly to the people might be preferable to a distanced unrelatable to person who speaks only with elitist language.

          1.4.3.6.2.4. Pro:
          President Trump was unable to accept criticism, took no responsibility for his words and actions, and his behavior and character were not presidential [931].

      1.4.3.7. Con:
      This statement assumes that standing and prestige in the eyes of the world is more important than efficient management of governmental agencies and services (including immigration) in the US.

        1.4.3.7.1. Con:
        President Trump didn't bring "efficient management of governmental agencies and services."

          1.4.3.7.1.1. Pro:
          President Trump weakened many government agencies [932], like the CIA, FBI, EPA, and USPS, through sowing distrust, reducing funding, and/or not filling important positions when he first became president.

        1.4.3.7.2. Con:
        "Standing and prestige" are related [933] to foreign policy and negotiations with other countries. A decrease in standing/prestige indicates poor foreign policy and hinders negotiations.

    1.4.4. Pro:
    President Trump strengthened the US military.

      1.4.4.1. Con:
      President Trump failed to take action [934] against bounties being placed on American soldiers.

        1.4.4.1.1. Con:
        That report was never proven as fact. The report itself said it was unverified speculation. It has been blown out of proportion by the media. [1 [935]]

        1.4.4.1.2. Con:
        There were too many bounties, and not many of them ended in the soldier dying. If he had tried to save even a few, the media would slander him for favoring some soldiers over others, so instead of wasting resources, he did other things.

      1.4.4.2. Con:
      President Trump's continued public shaming of the military [936] during his administration created an environment where early retirement or moving to the private sector for a much higher salary had never been more attractive.

        1.4.4.2.1. Pro:
        Leaders [937] in the Department of Defense and intelligence agencies retired in record numbers under President Trump [938].

          1.4.4.2.1.1. Con:
          Some of the senior officers who openly criticized President Trump retired before he became the president [939].

        1.4.4.2.2. Pro:
        President Trump snubbed [940] military veterans and a Remembrance Day service at a US cemetery in Europe to honour fallen soldiers and the 100th Anniversary of the end of the First World War, because of rain.

      1.4.4.3. Con:
      Under President Trump, the US military was involved in various human rights violations.

        1.4.4.3.1. Pro:
        President Trump received strong criticism for banning LGBT+ servicepersons [941] from military services.

        1.4.4.3.2. Pro:
        -> See 1.1.7.7.2.

      1.4.4.4. Pro:
      Military spending steadily increased [942] during President Trump's time in office.

        1.4.4.4.1. Con:
        President Trump started to cut military spending in January 2019, as he initially announced plans for continued growth from $716 billion in the fiscal year 2019 to $733 billion in 2020, but he later asked the Department of Defense to plan reductions [943] to a $700 billion budget.

        1.4.4.4.2. Pro:
        -> See 1.1.2.5.2.

        1.4.4.4.3. Pro:
        US military spending has been increasing since 2015 [944], getting close to the levels reached at the height of Iraq war.

        1.4.4.4.4. Con:
        President Trump didn't restore military funding, as his military budget was quite similar to Obama's [945].

        1.4.4.4.5. Pro:
        Underfunding the military leaves them with outdated equipment and capabilities, and puts the lives of servicemembers in unnecessary danger.

      1.4.4.5. Pro:
      President Trump helped establish the Space Force [946], which serves the critical mission of protecting US military assets in space.

        1.4.4.5.1. Pro:
        Astronauts were sent into space for the first time in 9 years [947] due to President Trump's strong support for space ventures.

        1.4.4.5.2. Pro:
        International cyberspace warfare operations are a new threat [948] vector to the US. Without military funding, American life and security are at risk.

        1.4.4.5.3. Con:
        President Trump created the Space Force despite the fact the US Defense Secretary [949], Jim Mattis, warned against it.

          1.4.4.5.3.1. Pro:
          James Mattis was opposed to the creation of the Space Force because it would hinder the integration of defense functions [950].

            1.4.4.5.3.1.1. Pro:
            Mattis also resigned in 2018, citing fundamental disagreements with President Trump’s military policies [951].

            1.4.4.5.3.1.2. Con:
            Mattis later agreed on the need to view space "as a warfighting domain [952]".

          1.4.4.5.3.2. Con:
          Although James Mattis initially opposed the creation of the Space Force due to budgetary concerns, he later supported it [953].

        1.4.4.5.4. Pro:
        In December 2019, President Trump signed the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act [954], which directed the establishment of the US Space Force [955] as the sixth branch of the US Armed Forces.

        1.4.4.5.5. Con:
        The Air Force Space Command [956] already existed when President Trump proposed the Space Force.

      1.4.4.6. Pro:
      Under President Trump, the US military defeated the ISIS caliphate and killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi [957].

      1.4.4.7. Con:
      The military was already far stronger than necessary. It was just a waste of money.

        1.4.4.7.1. Pro:
        Exponentially expanding the military reach and expanding an army's operations are historically unbecoming of great empires, such as Rome. Researchers believe the US is heading in a similar direction. [958]

        1.4.4.7.2. Pro:
        As of May 2020, the US military spent more than the next 10 nations combined [959], of which some are allies or close NATO member-states.

      1.4.4.8. Con:
      President Trump's undermining of the Uniform Code of Military Justice [960] (UCMJ) with his pardons of US war criminals [961] were a detriment to morale and order.

      1.4.4.9. Pro:
      President Trump managed to get other NATO [962] countries to commit to increasing their financial contributions to the military alliance, as promised [963].

      1.4.4.10. Pro:
      Servicemembers had favorable views of President Trump, which improved their morale.

        1.4.4.10.1. Pro:
        Only 40% [964] of servicemembers had a negative view of the President.

          1.4.4.10.1.1. Con:
          Considering how unpopular President Trump was with the public, this statistic doesn't say much. The survey [965] also shows that the majority of officers disapproved of President Trump, with only 30% supporting him.

            1.4.4.10.1.1.1. Pro:
            The only branch of the army where President Trump enjoyed a favorability of over 50% was the Marines, and that was because the Marines loved Mattis [966], President Trump's cabinet pick.

          1.4.4.10.1.2. Con:
          This has changed. 50% of servicemembers had a negative view as of December 2019 [967], and it's likely slipped further [968] after he announced intentions to use the military against BLM protesters, and other actions.

        1.4.4.10.2. Con:
        Many veterans were horrified [969] by President Trump's actions towards Sen. John McCain, to the point of the unprecedented step of drafting and sending a letter demanding that he follow protocol.

          1.4.4.10.2.1. Pro:
          Despite his claims that he had done more for veterans than John McCain [970], President Trump had a long history of disparaging military service [971].

        1.4.4.10.3. Con:
        Given the increase in defense spending under Trump [972], servicemembers were unlikely to be objective in their view.

          1.4.4.10.3.1. Pro:
          In 2018, President Trump requested Congress for $639 billion [973] in military spending, which represented a 10% increase since 2017.

        1.4.4.10.4. Con:
        This doesn't necessarily mean that President Trump's military policies were sound. A higher rate of support among servicemembers could also be attributable to their political affiliation.

  1.5. Con:
  President Trump had low public [974] and expert [975] approval.

    1.5.1. Con:
    It is not uncommon for presidents who end up being popular to experience periods of unpopularity and polarization.

      1.5.1.1. Pro:
      President Trump's approval rating after the first 486 days of his presidency was the same as Reagan's [976] and Carter's.

      1.5.1.2. Pro:
      Abraham Lincoln was deeply unpopular [977] for much of his life. He is now routinely ranked as the greatest president of all time [978].

      1.5.1.3. Con:
      The major difference was the starting approval. President Trump's approval started under 50% [979] (with 42.6) and he ended his presidency with 58% of disapproval [980].

    1.5.2. Pro:
    A survey of 391 political experts [981] from the American Political Science Association [982] ranked President Trump as the worst president.

      1.5.2.1. Pro:
      According to some historians [983], President Trump was the worst president in US history.

      1.5.2.2. Pro:
      When asked, even conservative scholars [984] who identify themselves as Republicans, placed President Trump in the 40th position of the worst US presidents.

    1.5.3. Pro:
    President Trump often seemed unaware of what he was talking about, which made him appear untrustworthy.

      1.5.3.1. Pro:
      President Trump's speeches and public statements demonstrated little knowledge [985] of or experience in a number of the key issues essential to an effective presidency.

        1.5.3.1.1. Pro:
        President Trump's quotes on mental health [986] demonstrated no understanding of the issue, folding both to stigma and misinformation.

          1.5.3.1.1.1. Con:
          Many quotes given in the support article don’t demonstrate this at all, and many people would agree with them. For example, the link between mental illness and mass shootings. [987]

            1.5.3.1.1.1.1. Pro:
            There's a link between illness and crime. One-third of mass shootings are committed by people with mental illness [988].

            1.5.3.1.1.1.2. Con:
            A strong causal link between mental illness and mass shootings is demonstrably untrue [989] despite being a common [990] misconception [991].

              1.5.3.1.1.1.2.1. Pro:
              The fact that mass shootings are linked to mental illness is a proven criminal myth [992].

              1.5.3.1.1.1.2.2. Con:
              There is a causal link between serious mental illness and violence [993].

          1.5.3.1.1.2. Pro:
          The National Alliance on Mental Illness expressed serious concerns [994] about President Trump's attitude to mental health.

          1.5.3.1.1.3. Pro:
          President Trump continually drew false parallels [995] between criminality and mental health, when this is utterly false.

            1.5.3.1.1.3.1. Pro:
            Only 3-5% of violent acts [996] can be attributed to mental illness.

            1.5.3.1.1.3.2. Pro:
            "You have people that are mentally ill. And they're gonna come through the cracks. And they're going to do things that people will not even believe are possible." - this was an example of President Trump's gross misrepresentation of people with mental health problems. (Meet the Press, 4/10/15 [997])

        1.5.3.1.2. Pro:
        Caught on the spot, President Trump couldn't formulate a speech. He abused clichés and occasionally repeated himself [998].

        1.5.3.1.3. Pro:
        President Trump had no understanding of climate change [999].

          1.5.3.1.3.1. Con:
          Climate science is exceptionally complicated, therefore it is not unreasonable to express skepticism.

            1.5.3.1.3.1.1. Con:
            It is alarming that President Trump - who was in a position to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement [1000] - was so patently not in possession of even basic facts.

          1.5.3.1.3.2. Con:
          President Trump, like most politicians, was not a scientist, and like him, very few politicians have a reasonable understanding of climate change.

            1.5.3.1.3.2.1. Pro:
            Climate science [1001] is very hard to understand and integrate into politics.

            1.5.3.1.3.2.2. Con:
            -> See 1.5.3.1.3.1.1.

          1.5.3.1.3.3. Pro:
          Statements like "It's really cold outside, they are calling it a major freeze, weeks ahead of normal. Man, we could use a big fat dose of global warming [1002]!" illustrate his lack of understanding.

          1.5.3.1.3.4. Pro:
          President Trump argued that global warming was a Chinese hoax [1003].

            1.5.3.1.3.4.1. Pro:
            President Trump derided climate change [1004] as a hoax concocted by China and the regulations of Paris as stifling to American growth.

              1.5.3.1.3.4.1.1. Pro:
              As a consequence of President Trump's views on the regulations of Paris, the US withdrew from the Paris agreement on the 1st of June, 2017 [1005].

              1.5.3.1.3.4.1.2. Con:
              President Trump admitted in 2018 that climate change wasn't a hoax [1006].

            1.5.3.1.3.4.2. Con:
            In 2009, Trump signed a full-page advert in the New York Times [1007], expressing his support for legislation combating climate change [1008].

          1.5.3.1.3.5. Pro:
          President Trump denied that climate change is a lasting problem and believed it will "fix itself [1009]", countering science and blaming scientists for having their own "agenda [1010]".

            1.5.3.1.3.5.1. Pro:
            President Trump's denial of climate change [1011] was globally harmful. [1012]

            1.5.3.1.3.5.2. Con:
            President Trump publicly acknowledged the role of humans in climate change [1013].

        1.5.3.1.4. Pro:
        President Trump's grasp on nuclear proliferation and nuclear fission was cause for concern among many experts. [1014]

      1.5.3.2. Pro:
      President Trump said some patently [1015] bizarre [1016], outrageous [1017], stupid [1018], and [1019] ridiculous [1020] things [1021].

        1.5.3.2.1. Pro:
        President Trump's statements frequently displayed arrogance.

          1.5.3.2.1.1. Con:
          Many of President Trump's supporters claimed that the US needed an arrogant president [1022].

          1.5.3.2.1.2. Pro:
          "We are going to have an unbelievable, perhaps record-setting turnout for the inauguration" was a statement of sheer arrogance, particularly ironic in retrospect given how few turned up [1023].

            1.5.3.2.1.2.1. Con:
            The explanation of the confusion was later explained because the crowd looked big from "President Trump’s vantage point at the Capitol [1024]."

            1.5.3.2.1.2.2. Pro:
            President Trump stole a photo [1025] from Obama's inauguration to make it appear as though he attracted a larger crowd.

          1.5.3.2.1.3. Pro:
          -> See 1.1.4.12.1.2.

          1.5.3.2.1.4. Pro:
          "My Twitter has become so powerful that I can actually make my enemies tell the truth." This is an example of a ridiculous (and arrogant) statement [1026], insofar that it was neither true nor likely to ever be true.

          1.5.3.2.1.5. Pro:
          "My IQ is one of the highest — and you all know it! Please don’t feel so stupid or insecure; it’s not your fault." and "I'm intelligent. Some people would say I'm very, very, very intelligent." are two quotes that demonstrate arrogance and have no backing; in fact, analysis has suggested that President Trump spoke at the level of an 8-year-old [1027].

            1.5.3.2.1.5.1. Pro:
            President Trump [1028] managed to color [1029] the American [1030] flag [1031] incorrectly [1032].

            1.5.3.2.1.5.2. Pro:
            President Trump claimed to be "a very stable genius [1033]", but refused to be independently tested on this.

        1.5.3.2.2. Con:
        Many of the examples given are being deliberately misinterpreted or exaggerated. President Trump's unique communication style meant that people who were predisposed to hate him could easily interpret them in the worst possible light.

          1.5.3.2.2.1. Pro:
          President Trump did not generalize that all Mexicans are rapists [1034].

          1.5.3.2.2.2. Pro:
          President Trump refused to bow to political correctness [1035].

        1.5.3.2.3. Pro:
        "Any negative polls are fake news [1036]" is an alarming statement nodding towards the conspiracy theory of 'fake news'. For any statesman to outright deny anything that contradicts their worldview - regardless of legitimacy - shows a lack of professional integrity. It is conceivable that negative polls exist, and are accurate.

          1.5.3.2.3.1. Pro:
          -> See 1.1.4.5.1.2.1.2.

        1.5.3.2.4. Pro:
        President Trump made many personal insults [1037] that came across as petty, unpleasant, and unbecoming of a statesman, regardless of whether anybody perceived them as true.

          1.5.3.2.4.1. Pro:
          "If I were running ‘The View’, I’d fire Rosie O’Donnell. I mean, I’d look at her right in that fat, ugly face of hers, I’d say ‘Rosie, you’re fired. [1038]" - similarly, to call anybody 'fat' and 'ugly' is not the conduct one expects from a public figure.

          1.5.3.2.4.2. Pro:
          President Trump retweeted disparaging personal comments about Hillary Clinton [1039].

          1.5.3.2.4.3. Pro:
          Similarly with Rand Paul: "I never attacked him on his looks, and believe me, there's plenty of subject matter right there. [1040]"

        1.5.3.2.5. Pro:
        "One of the key problems today is that politics is such a disgrace. Good people don’t go into government." - this was deeply ironic, and thus fairly ridiculous.

          1.5.3.2.5.1. Con:
          This is a widely held belief, and it is unclear what is bizarre or ridiculous about this quote.

            1.5.3.2.5.1.1. Con:
            What is ridiculous is the person who said it went into politics himself.

        1.5.3.2.6. Pro:
        "The point is, you can never be too greedy [1041]." - this is self-explanatory insofar as President Trump's moral standards and priorities.

        1.5.3.2.7. Pro:
        "I was down there, and I watched our police and our firemen, down on 7-Eleven, down at the World Trade Center, right after it came down” - mistake or not, to wrongly post [1042] in public about such a huge disaster is problematic for a President.

          1.5.3.2.7.1. Pro:
          President Trump's statements regarding 9/11 have been very disrespectful [1043] and at points seemingly self-serving.

            1.5.3.2.7.1.1. Pro:
            This includes saying that he believes he "could have stopped it" through immigration measures [1044], which is both implausible and disrespectful to the victims.

        1.5.3.2.8. Pro:
        He also attributed "'Make America Great Again" to himself, despite it being Reagan's campaign slogan [1045].

        1.5.3.2.9. Con:
        Not all of these quotes are wrong; President Trump said that he has a "great relationship with African Americans" and" great respect for them [1046]." This was true with opinion polls [1047] showing vastly elevated African-American support since his election.

        1.5.3.2.10. Pro:
        His statement “Why are we having all these people from shithole countries coming here [1048]?” was prejudicial and inappropriate for a President.

      1.5.3.3. Con:
      39% of Americans thought the US was on the "right track" [1049] in 2018.

    1.5.4. Con:
    It is impossible to judge the public approval of President Trump by media charts and ‘expert’ panels.

    1.5.5. Pro:
    President Trump was not elected by the majority of voters [1050], he was elected by the Electoral College [1051].

      1.5.5.1. Con:
      This doesn't mean that he had low approval ratings, this means that he had enough approval to trigger the exception of the voting system [1052].

      1.5.5.2. Pro:
      The 2020 election was the largest possible poll of approval and in that election Trump lost by a significant margin, becoming one of only 10 US presidents in history to fail to get reelected [1053].

        1.5.5.2.1. Con:
        Even though he lost the 2020 presidential election, Donald Trump still earned the second-highest number of votes [1054] of any presidential candidate in history.

      1.5.5.3. Con:
      Other candidates have won the presidency without a majority of votes [1055].

        1.5.5.3.1. Pro:
        President George W. Bush won the 2000 election without winning a majority of votes due to a close contest in Florida. [1056]

      1.5.5.4. Pro:
      Hillary Clinton received nearly three million more votes [1057] than Donald Trump in the 2016 election.

    1.5.6. Con:
    This is an appeal to popularity or "argumentum ad populum [1058]" (appeal to the people) which is a common logical fallacy.

      1.5.6.1. Con:
      Effectiveness in terms of a democratically elected head of state can only be measured in the representativeness of the public will (p. 388 [1059]).

        1.5.6.1.1. Con:
        Political polarization has increased "partisan motivated reasoning [1060]" regarding any president's evaluations.

      1.5.6.2. Pro:
      Public and expert approval can be manipulated and influenced by the media (p. 1 [1061]).

        1.5.6.2.1. Con:
        People are influenced by the media, however certains groups within the media overdefend Trump, which might have actually increased his popularity above what it would be in a more objective setting.

          1.5.6.2.1.1. Pro:
          Media outlets, such as Fox News [1062], put out extremely positive material on Trump.

          1.5.6.2.1.2. Pro:
          Trump was a master of mobilising the power of ressentiment and applying it via mass and social media (p. 81 [1063]).

          1.5.6.2.1.3. Pro:
          One America News Network has been accused of peddling pro-Trump propaganda to such a degree that they are being threatened with legal action for defamation [1064].

          1.5.6.2.1.4. Pro:
          With a final approval rating of just 34% [1065], it is possible for a significant proportion of Trump's remaining support to come from media propaganda.

      1.5.6.3. Con:
      Public [1066] opinion [1067] and approval [1068], as well as public [1069] opinion polls [1070], are good [1071] metrics [1072] of whether someone is doing a good job and is a subjectively [1073] good president.

        1.5.6.3.1. Pro:
        Most democracies use public opinion polls and select candidates in popular elections. These represent public opinion, which is the cornerstone of democracy [1074].

        1.5.6.3.2. Pro:
        Most respected and reputable opinion polls are conducted at random to try to get a representative sample and eliminate bias, thus giving a good indication of general public consensus and feeling.

          1.5.6.3.2.1. Con:
          Many polls may be subject to reporting bias [1075] and non-response bias [1076], where only people motivated to answer do so, creating a skew in the results.

            1.5.6.3.2.1.1. Pro:
            This was particularly evident in exit polls for both the 2016 and 2020 elections, where the media and pollsters regularly got it wrong and did not expect such tight or close races.

            1.5.6.3.2.1.2. Pro:
            Many Republican (and Trump) supporters allegedly gave false or misleading [1077] answers, because they distrusted the pollsters and media.

          1.5.6.3.2.2. Pro:
          Trump consistently polled badly overall in a majority of polls [1078], and left office with the lowest first-term approval of any President, ever [1079], with one of the lowest approval rates and one of the highest disapproval rates.

        1.5.6.3.3. Pro:
        Public opinion and voting are used in popularity contests, pageants, and other forms of public voting. Public opinion is subjective but this is one way to realistically measure it.

        1.5.6.3.4. Con:
        "Good" is subjective. Different people have different definitions of what is "good" compared to others.

  1.6. Con:
  President Trump may not have been loyal [1080] to the US.

    1.6.1. Pro:
    President Trump allegedly colluded [1081] with a hostile foreign power [1082] to hack US elections [1083].

      1.6.1.1. Con:
      Mueller did not find enough evidence [1084] to charge either Donald Trump or any of his allies with taking part in a criminal conspiracy.

      1.6.1.2. Con:
      Allegations mean nothing without proof.

        1.6.1.2.1. Pro:
        Due process [1085] is a fundamental constitutional right in the US, enshrined in the 5th and 14th Amendments. Claiming that a person is guilty based solely on allegations denies this right.

      1.6.1.3. Pro:
      A president is expected to uphold the Constitution and the law of the land. If President Trump broke the law to become president, this should disqualify him from being considered good.

      1.6.1.4. Pro:
      The coordination of Russian-backed hackers [1086] gaining access to Clinton's emails, and President Trump's public call is a brazen smoking gun considering that the two events occurred on the same day. [1087]

        1.6.1.4.1. Con:
        "Russia backed hackers" was plain speculation on part of the US government without any real proof.

          1.6.1.4.1.1. Pro:
          Wikileaks [1088], on multiple occasions, said that Russia had no part in accessing the Clinton illegal server.

          1.6.1.4.1.2. Pro:
          The news organizations still have to use the word "allegedly" in their articles describing the Russian interference.

        1.6.1.4.2. Con:
        What was said by President Trump was a try to point out how illegal was what Clinton had done and that if Russia had these emails, it would be a favor to the US if Russia handed them over.

    1.6.2. Pro:
    He put more trust in Vladimir Putin [1089] and Kim Jong-un [1090] than in our own intelligence agencies [1091].

      1.6.2.1. Pro:
      President Trump's deference to Putin and Russia indicated that he may have been financially [1092] compromised.

        1.6.2.1.1. Con:
        Putin is a strong personality that pulled a whole nation out of a huge crisis [1093]. There is nothing wrong with respecting such a person. This claim suggests that any dealing with Putin or Russia is "evil", and this has become a cliche.

      1.6.2.2. Con:
      US intelligence failed [1094] multiple times to provide proper evidence, leading to illegal wars.

      1.6.2.3. Con:
      Such a claim suggests that listening to other nations outside the traditional alliance is some sort of crime. Previous presidents [1 [1095]] [2 [1096]] did this and ended up with multiple wars [1097] today while President Trump didn't start any other war. Unless the point is to start more wars.

    1.6.3. Con:
    In America, people are considered innocent until proven guilty [1098]. President Trump had not been found guilty [1099] as of the end of his presidency.

      1.6.3.1. Con:
      It is hard to be proven guilty when one directly intervenes into the investigation of his own abuse of power. President Trump stopped and tainted the process - and made this claim of unproven guilt empty and irrelevant in his case.

        1.6.3.1.1. Pro:
        President Trump fired the director of the FBI [1100] who was responsible for the process of accountability.

      1.6.3.2. Con:
      President Trump has been found guilty on multiple accounts [1101].

      1.6.3.3. Con:
      A majority of Congress [1102] agreed President Trump was not innocent.

        1.6.3.3.1. Pro:
        Multiple Republican representatives agreed that President Trump was guilty [1103], but choose not to hold him responsible.

      1.6.3.4. Con:
      Trump has admitted his guilt. He has yet to be criminally prosecuted.

    1.6.4. Con:
    President Trump supported the US police [1104] because he knew their importance for ordinary people.

    1.6.5. Con:
    Trump identified Antifa as a terrorist organization [1105], indicating that he was loyal to the US and its safety.

      1.6.5.1. Con:
      Being loyal means consistently doing things that are good for the country. Occasional good behavior doesn't prove anything.

      1.6.5.2. Con:
      He attacked the left-leaning Antifa terrorists, but refused to do the same for the right-leaning white supremacists [1106].

        1.6.5.2.1. Pro:
        President Trump never denounced white supremacists. Instead, he told them in September 2020 to "stand down and stand by." [1107]

          1.6.5.2.1.1. Con:
          President Trump condemned all white supremacists including the 'Proud Boys [1108]' in October 2020.

            1.6.5.2.1.1.1. Con:
            President Trump didn't condemn white supremacists, he commanded them to "stand back and stand by" [1109].

            1.6.5.2.1.1.2. Pro:
            President Trump stated in October 2020 that he condemned all white supremacists [1110].

          1.6.5.2.1.2. Pro:
          After President Trump's comment, "the far-right, anti-immigrant, all-male group with a history of street violence against left-wing opponents", Proud Boys [1111], posted the logo "Stand Back, Stand By" on their social media account.

        1.6.5.2.2. Con:
        President Trump denounced racism [1112] in Charlottesville in 2017 by saying that "the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis, and white supremacists were 'repugnant' to everything Americans held dear."

      1.6.5.3. Pro:
      President Trump designated Antifa as a terrorist organization because it had instigated violence and was connected with domestic terrorism [1113].

        1.6.5.3.1. Con:
        Antifa does not fit the definition [1114] of a terrorist organization.

          1.6.5.3.1.1. Pro:
          Antifa, as it is known in popular vernacular, is often conflated with anarchist black bloc tactics [1115].

        1.6.5.3.2. Pro:
        Federal law enforcement [1116] has an obligation to stop extremist organizations that participate in violent attacks.

        1.6.5.3.3. Con:
        Media outlets and personalities defined them as such, however they were not a self identified group.

      1.6.5.4. Pro:
      The US is a fascist country, and Trump was upholding its values.

        1.6.5.4.1. Con:
        America is not a fascist country, and Trump was not acting in accordance with its values.

    1.6.6. Pro:
    President Trump repeatedly attacked [1117] the Department of Justice, seeming to prefer defending political allies over allowing a department headed by his own Attorney General to follow its course.

      1.6.6.1. Pro:
      President Trump engaging with the legal process in a questionable way [1118] consisted of his repeated questioning of the Special Counsel investigation despite the fact there was no concrete evidence incriminating him personally.

        1.6.6.1.1. Con:
        The President pointing out conflicts of interest [1119] in the Special Counsel's investigation was completely reasonable.

      1.6.6.2. Con:
      As the party leader, it was his job to support and endorse members of the Republican Party.

      1.6.6.3. Con:
      The DOJ [1120] is part of the executive branch [1121], so it is right and proper for the president to ensure it is following the right course, and to criticize it when it fails to live up to his standards.

        1.6.6.3.1. Con:
        The DOJ should not be guided by Trump's standards, but by those that best support the operation and improvement of the US.

          1.6.6.3.1.1. Con:
          As the elected President, Trump bore responsibility for overseeing the operation of numerous federal agencies and departments [1122], including the DOJ.

          1.6.6.3.1.2. Pro:
          The DOJ should follows the standards of US law, as they state in their mission statement [1123].

        1.6.6.3.2. Pro:
        The US Constitution confers executive authority on the elected president [1124].

          1.6.6.3.2.1. Con:
          The support of the people and their agreement with his standards is also important, otherwise the president can be impeached [1125], which is also established in the US Constitution.

          1.6.6.3.2.2. Pro:
          The powers of the president of the US are included in those explicitly granted by Article II [1126] of the US Constitution [1127].

      1.6.6.4. Con:
      Jeff Sessions was a political ally of President Trump, and indeed he was one of the first senators to endorse candidate Trump's candidacy [1128]. Therefore, it does not appear that President Trump was criticizing Sessions because he was not an ally, but rather because he didn't approve of his job performance.

        1.6.6.4.1. Con:
        President Trump's criticisms of Sessions only began when Sessions refused to shield [1129] and protect [1130] him from FBI investigation [1131]. They intensified [1132] when Sessions [1133] recused [1134] himself [1135] and refused [1136] to end [1137] the Russia [1138] Election [1139] Tampering [1140] Investigation [1141]. This would indicate that his criticisms [1142] were based on his perception [1143] that Sessions [1144] was not [1145] personally [1146] loyal [1147] directly [1148] to him [1149].

          1.6.6.4.1.1. Con:
          Sessions should have told President Trump he was going to recuse himself from anything to do with the Trump campaign. It would not have been unreasonable for Trump to select a different Attorney General who wasn't conflicted.

      1.6.6.5. Con:
      President Trump's "attacks" on government agencies served to bring more transparency into what roles they actually played in a government.

      1.6.6.6. Pro:
      President Trump pardoned [1150] Joe Arpaio for contempt of court, disrespecting the rule of law.

      1.6.6.7. Pro:
      President Trump wanted immunity for himself [1151] and his allies while he continued to ask the Justice Department to illegally prosecute Democrats.

        1.6.6.7.1. Pro:
        President Trump encouraged his supporters to press for the arrest of Hillary Clinton by inciting chants of "lock her up [1152]" at his rallies.

    1.6.7. Pro:
    President Trump was impeached twice.

      1.6.7.1. Pro:
      In 2019, President Trump was impeached [1153], being only the third president in history to face charges.

        1.6.7.1.1. Con:
        Party-line impeachment [1154] and acquittal [1155] is not a good way to measure a president's success.

          1.6.7.1.1.1. Con:
          Republican Mitt Romney [1156], the only senator to break party lines, became the first US senator to vote to convict a president of his own party in an impeachment trial, as he voted for conviction on abuse of power.

        1.6.7.1.2. Pro:
        President Trump was impeached in 2019 after being accused of pressuring Ukraine to find damaging information on Joe Biden, and his son Hunter [1157].

      1.6.7.2. Pro:
      President Trump was acquitted twice from two of the most unconstitutional impeachments in American history.

    1.6.8. Pro:
    Trump's actions as president undermined democracy [1158].

      1.6.8.1. Con:
      President Trump supported pro-democracy protesters in Hong-Kong [1159] protest by signing into law a bill.

        1.6.8.1.1. Pro:
        Some Hong Kong democracy activists [1160] supported President Trump's reelection in 2020.

        1.6.8.1.2. Con:
        The funds that were intended to support Hong Kong protesters were frozen in June 2020 [1161].

        1.6.8.1.3. Con:
        The Hong Kong protestors are not necessarily fighting for a good cause, and supporting them is not an indicator of virtue.

      1.6.8.2. Pro:
      President Trump violated several democratic norms [1162] during his presidency.

        1.6.8.2.1. Pro:
        -> See 1.3.4.1.3.2.

        1.6.8.2.2. Pro:
        President Trump used the legal system to attack political opponents [1163], and he expressed admiration for foreign autocrats.

      1.6.8.3. Pro:
      President Trump did not respect the legitimacy of the 2020 elections [1164].

        1.6.8.3.1. Pro:
        The refusal of a president to commit to a peaceful transition of power disgraces the office.

          1.6.8.3.1.1. Pro:
          On the night of the elections, President Trump threatened to go to the Supreme Court to stop [1165] the counting of the vote.

        1.6.8.3.2. Pro:
        President Trump encouraged his supporters to fight [1166] after the 2020 election's results.

          1.6.8.3.2.1. Pro:
          The attack on the Capitol on the 6th of January 2021 [1167], promoted in part by President Trump and undertaken by his supporters, represented a direct attack on US democracy.

            1.6.8.3.2.1.1. Con:
            President Trump condemned [1168] the violence at the Capitol, and should not be held liable for the actions of his supporters.

              1.6.8.3.2.1.1.1. Con:
              President Trump made many provocations that incited his supporters to act violently at the Capitol. [1169]

              1.6.8.3.2.1.1.2. Con:
              President Trump's supporters, who attacked the Capitol, acknowledged that they did so because of what President Trump told them about the election [1170].

            1.6.8.3.2.1.2. Con:
            President Trump’s words [1171] “peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard today" were never reported by the liberal media, and his words “fight like hell” were taken out of context.

            1.6.8.3.2.1.3. Pro:
            President Trump, or one of his associates, appears to have destroyed phone records [1172] related to the attack on the Capitol, strongly implying he has something to hide.

          1.6.8.3.2.2. Pro:
          President Trump incited violence at a rally before the 6th of January 2020 by saying "if you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a country anymore [1173]."

          1.6.8.3.2.3. Con:
          President Trump denied any responsibility [1174] for the Capitol attack.

            1.6.8.3.2.3.1. Con:
            Trump can deny responsibility; but that doesn't absolve him of it or magically make it go away. Many of those arrested or were there have stated that they were there because of Trump [1175].

        1.6.8.3.3. Con:
        Many US presidents who have lost reelection do not respect the legitimacy of the election they lost.

      1.6.8.4. Con:
      American democracy was already undermined before President Trump: it was polarized and based on race and economic inequality [1176] which ultimately caused the erosion of democratic norms.

      1.6.8.5. Pro:
      President Trump had 11 of a possible 14 [1177] on a fascism score chart.

        1.6.8.5.1. Pro:
        President Trump engaged in performative fascism [1178] during his administration.

        1.6.8.5.2. Con:

      1.6.8.6. Pro:
      Many international leaders and experts considered President Trump a threat to democracy [1180].

        1.6.8.6.1. Con:
        Many international leaders also supported President Trump [1181].

          1.6.8.6.1.1. Con:
          Given Trump's position as President of the US, many leaders could not have afforded to not support him.

        1.6.8.6.2. Con:
        Europe's far-right parties [1182] considered President Trump an example to follow.

"- County of Los Angeles, Chief Administrative Officer. Report on the Fiscal Costs of Illegal Aliens in Los Angeles County. 1991.

This report assessed taxes paid to the county by an estimated 770,000 illegal aliens and their service and assistance costs to the county. It found county revenues of $137.6 million and county outlays of $413.8 million, for a deficit for illegals of $276.2 million in FY'91.

GOIRA estimated there were 550,000 illegal aliens in Texas in 1992. They paid $290 million in state and local taxes and generated state and local service and assistance costs of $456 million, for a deficit of $166 million. Applying the lower estimate of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) of 350,000 illegal aliens in Texas, GOlRA estimated total costs and revenues at $313 million and $183 million respectively, for a deficit of $130 million."

"Drafted by top advisers Jared Kushner and Stephen Miller, the proposal outlines an immigration system that focuses mostly on those with specific professional skills and education, replacing decades-old laws favoring relatives of other immigrants.

“It would be a big departure from our current system,” says Stephen Yale-Loehr, a professor of immigration law practice at Cornell University. “Right now two-thirds of all immigrants who are admitted are based on some kind of family characteristic.”"

"What is a merit-based green card system?

A merit-based green card system uses a point system to determine who can immigrate to and live in a country. Many countries award points based on job, career or language skills. Most merit-based systems focus on strengthening the host country’s economy.

Along that line, in February of 2017, U.S. Senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue introduced the RAISE Act, Senate Bill 354. RAISE is an acronym that stands for Reforming American Immigration for Strong Employment. It is part of a larger plan to make the U.S. immigration system more merit-based."

"The number of people admitted to the US as refugees each year is determined by a system of quotas, the size of which are ultimately defined by the president. People seeking to move to the US as refugees must make their applications from outside the country, and need to convince US officials that they are vulnerable to persecution at home.

Mr Trump's hostility to any immigration from Muslim-majority countries is well known - he once pledged to enact a "complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States" - and a reduction in refugee quotas proved easier to implement than an outright ban, which became mired in legal challenges.

As a result, the number of refugees admitted from a number of majority-Muslim countries, including Iraq, Somalia, Iran and Syria, fell almost to zero soon after he took office."

"A simple virus has brought life as we know it to a screeching halt.

We have faced viral threats before, including pandemics, yet the world does not shut down for every new infection or flu season.

So what is it about this coronavirus? What are the quirks of its biology that pose a unique threat to our bodies and our lives?"

"In his first speech after his hospitalization for Covid-19, President Donald Trump stood on a White House balcony on October 10 and made a grand declaration about the coronavirus: “It’s going to disappear. It is disappearing.”

His words might have sounded more dramatic had he not been saying the same thing for eight months.

Trump has stuck to the refrain no matter what has been happening with the pandemic. Since February, the President has declared at least 38 times that Covid-19 is either going to disappear or is currently disappearing.

His proclamations have been wildly inaccurate. When Trump first started making the claim in February, it was about the time the US had just suffered its very first known Covid-19 death. More than 220,000 deaths later, Trump continues to falsely claim that the virus will somehow just go away — even as the US experiences yet another surge in cases and hospitalizations."

"Axios has obtained leaked, private schedules of President Donald Trump showing how he’s spent his time over the past three months. According to the leaked schedules, our president has spent 60% of his “working” hours since the midterms in unstructured “Executive Time.”

Executive Time is supposed to consist of time in the Oval Office, but Trump wakes before 6 a.m. and doesn’t leave the residence for five hours. He spends that time, according to Axios, “watching TV, reading the papers, and responding to what he sees and reads by phoning aides, members of Congress, friends, administration officials and informal advisers.” And, we can safely assume, tweeting like a madman."

[164] https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-executive-orders-barack-obama-president-powers-a9163431.html
"It wasn’t too long ago that Donald Trump derided presidential executive orders as “power grabs” and a “basic disaster.”

He’s switched sides in a big way: In each year of his presidency, he has issued more executive orders than did former President Barack Obama during the same time span. He surpassed Mr Obama’s third-year total just recently.

[...]

An executive order can have the same effect as a federal law — but its impact can be fleeting. Congress can pass a new law to override an executive order and future presidents can undo them."

"President Donald Trump took his first steps Thursday toward fulfilling his vow to dismantle Obamacare, signing an executive order that he says will bring affordable health insurance to millions more people.

The order broadly tasks the administration with developing policies to increase health care competition and choice in order to improve the quality of health care and lower prices."
[233] https://ballotpedia.org/Affordable_Care_Act_under_the_Trump_administration
"The House passed its bill—the American Health Care Act of 2017—but members of the Senate have been unable to agree on a final replacement plan, leaving most of the provisions of the ACA in place. Republicans did take one step towards changing the ACA by eliminating the law's individual mandate, which took effect in January 2019."

""I want crystal clean water and air."

That's what Donald Trump said in the first chaotic presidential debate with Joe Biden. But there is scant evidence of that desire in the actions of his administration, which has spent nearly four years systematically dismantling core environmental protections, some of which stretch back decades.

Experts agree that the climate crisis's most destructive manifestations, on display in a particularly difficult year for the US, barely scratch the surface of the catastrophes to come. [...] His administration has scrapped climate regulations, rolled back clean water rules and loosened pollution standards. Protections for public land and threatened species have been shrunk while new oil pipelines and coal mining have been encouraged.

The legacy of these changes will stretch well beyond Trump’s presidency."

Xi knew Trump was so desperate for a splashy art-of-the-deal trade pact that China could have its way with Hong Kong, troll Taiwan and do what it wanted with Muslim minorities in the north-western Xinjiang region. Beijing curried Trumpian favor by lavishing a slew of China patents to first daughter Ivanka Trump."

"Mr Trump's tariffs policy aims to encourage consumers to buy American products by making imported goods more expensive.

The US has imposed tariffs on more than $360bn (£268bn) of Chinese goods, and China has retaliated with tariffs on more than $110bn of US products.

Washington delivered three rounds of tariffs in 2018, and a fourth one in September last year. The most recent round targeted Chinese imports, from meat to musical instruments, with a 15% duty.

Beijing hit back with tariffs ranging from 5% to 25% on US goods."
[406] https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dollars-status-worlds-funding-currency-question-144437776.html
"U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war and America First protectionist policies could be helping to accelerate the end of the dollar’s (DX=F) reign as the world’s reserve currency, analysts warn.

Having already instituted worldwide tariffs on steel and aluminum and threatening more taxes on foreign products from China, the European Union and a host of other U.S. allies and rivals, the president is pushing foreign governments to reconsider holding dollars and U.S. Treasury reserves.

“Although the dollar will continue to be used in most trades, there is a possibility that participants in the global economy start to look at alternatives like pricing in euro or pricing in [Chinese] renminbi,” said Karl Schamotta, director of FX strategy and structured products at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto."
[407] https://bigthink.com/the-present/donald-trump-trade-mercantilism/
"Most economists agree that tariffs are a double-edged sword in the best cases and rarely recommend their use. The current trade war strikes many as strange at best and counter-productive at worst. There is a method to the madness, however. Donald Trump’s trade policies call back to mercantilism.
[...]
Not so much an ideology as it was a rationalization for policies that countries were implementing, it drove colonization and imperialism for much of the 17th and 18th centuries before being replaced by capitalism.

The idea was to maximize the value of your exports and minimize the value of your imports in order to increase the amount of wealth your country had. This was accomplished by preventing imports of finished products by means of tariffs, the promotion of domestic manufacturing, and strict control over the money supply."
[408] https://qz.com/929100/donald-trumps-zero-sum-worldview-is-explained-by-a-deep-flaw-in-the-industry-he-knows-best
"Since the late 1960s, when Donald Trump got his start in real estate, construction output per worker has fallen in the US. Now that he has the power to reshape the country’s economy as president, it matters that his worldview is informed by one of America’s least dynamic industries.
[...]
Trump’s experience in this stagnant, deal-based industry might explain his zero-sum approach to economic policy. The way to “win” in Trump’s mind—as detailed in his books and public statements—is by outmaneuvering your partners and opponents in negotiations, not by improving technology or developing new services. This makes sense in an industry with no productivity growth."
[409] http://theconversation.com/trumps-exports-good-imports-bad-trade-policy-debunked-by-an-economist-94625
"Like nearly all economists, I believe that contemporary mercantilism is wrong on three counts. First, trade is not a zero-sum game. Second, imposing new and higher tariffs on imports won’t make the U.S. trade deficit go away. Third, reciprocity in trade negotiations does not require all countries to cut their tariffs to the same level.
[...]
In short, I believe that the Trump administration’s trade policy is grounded in an ideology that was debunked long ago, lies outside mainstream economic thinking, and isn’t backed by any credible empirical evidence. This mindset could possibly push the U.S. into a full-blown trade war and undermine the established rules of the global trading system, endangering the global economy."
[410] https://qz.com/894085/donald-trumps-mercantilist-trade-policy-was-debunked-by-economist-adam-smith-more-than-200-years-ago/
"Trump’s administration is packed with mercantilists. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, and head of the National Trade Council Peter Navarro are all skeptical of the mutual benefits of international trade. During the campaign, Navarro and Ross wrote a position paper in their capacity as advisers that was classically mercantilist, arguing that reducing imports will boost US wealth. Conservative economist David Henderson says the report shows “a mind-boggling misunderstanding of the effect of trade on GDP.”

Trump’s views on trade are summed up by his feelings about his country’s relationship with China. Although some sectors of the US economy have been harmed by increased trade with China, the US has also benefitted greatly from the low cost of consumer goods imported from China, and the opportunity to export to such a large and fast-growing market. Trump doesn’t see this as a fair exchange."

"In his book "TrumpNation," reporter Timothy O'Brien estimated that real estate mogul and now-presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump was vastly overstating his net worth. In response, Trump sued O'Brien for libel and sought $5 billion in damages. While the courts ultimately dismissed the case for lacking merit, Trump said that he knew the lawsuit would fail but sued anyway. "I spent a couple of bucks on legal fees, and they spent a whole lot more. I did it to make his life miserable, which I'm happy about." Trump is not alone in using lawsuits, or the threat of lawsuits, to silence critics. Indeed, this has become such a problem in the United States that it is time for Congress to intervene, so that the court system does not merely become a tool to silence free speech among those who would speak out against powerful individuals and businesses."

"First Amendment

Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."
[529] https://lawshelf.com/shortvideoscontentview/freedom-of-speech-exceptions-categories-of-speech-not-protected
"While freedom of speech is one of the most sacrosanct freedoms in American history, there are a variety of exceptions to the general principle that speech is protected under the First Amendment.
[...]
Incitement of people to commit illegal or lawless activity is not protected by the First Amendment. In a seminal 1919 case, Schenk v. United States, the Supreme Court announced the “clear and present danger” test; that is, speech is not protected when it is used “in such circumstances and… of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger..."
[...]
A similar category to incitement, the Supreme Court has also indicated that “fighting words” are not protected by the First Amendment. Fighting words means words which “would likely make the person to whom they are addressed commit an act of violence.”
[...]
Defamation is a false statement about another person that tends to damage the reputation of that person. It is unprotected by the First Amendment."

"Donald Trump and six members of his inner circle will be big winners of the Republicans’ vast tax overhaul, with the president personally benefiting from a tax cut of up to $15m a year, research shows.

The US president chalked up his first big legislative win on Wednesday with the $1.5tn bill, the most sweeping revamp of the tax code in three decades, slashing taxes for corporations and the wealthy and dealing the heaviest blow yet to Obamacare."

"Trump has had mixed results fulfilling his promise to end "catch and release," the practice of catching immigrants who enter the country without documents and then releasing them with a notice to appear in immigration court at a later date.

As Trump campaigned in 2016, he promised to put an end to “catch and release,” the term his administration also uses to describe the process by which asylum-seeking migrants apprehended at the border are released from the government’s custody, into the custody of relatives and told to appear in court later."

"The president has slashed through regulations on everything from labour to the environment.

Just days after taking office he signed the Presidential Executive Order on Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs, which mandated that when government departments asked for a federal regulation, they had to specify two others they would drop.

Throughout his term he has continued to slash back red tape. In January 2020 he scrapped protections for US wetlands and streams, and in July he announced changes to the National Environmental Protection Act in a bid to speed up infrastructure projects.

"We are reclaiming America's proud heritage as a nation that gets things done," he said."

"Trump publicly downplayed the severity of the novel coronavirus, suggesting it would go away on its own, while comparing Covid-19, the disease it caused, to the seasonal flu.

“It’s going to disappear. One day — it’s like a miracle — it will disappear. And from our shores, we — you know, it could get worse before it gets better,” Trump said Feb. 28, with dozens of cases but no known fatalities in the U.S.

“We’re doing a great job with it. And it will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away,” Trump said March 10, when there were just over a thousand known infections and 30 deaths.

His view was disputed by public health experts, including the government’s own top scientists, who predicted that even with a strong, coordinated response, the virus wasn’t just going to “go away.” Later, the journalist Bob Woodward revealed that Trump had told him at the same time the president was publicly downplaying the virus’s severity, he knew it was more dangerous than the flu and “deadly.”"

And now a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA that draws from a detailed and well-sourced data set comes to an even more dramatic conclusion. It reports that between 2012 and 2018, compared with their U.S.-born neighbors, undocumented immigrants in Texas were less than half as likely to be arrested for violent crimes or drug offenses and less than a quarter as likely to be arrested for property crimes."

"The Trump administration is launching a global campaign to end the criminalization of homosexuality in dozens of nations where it's still illegal to be gay, U.S. officials tell NBC News, a bid aimed in part at denouncing Iran over its human rights record.

U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, the highest-profile openly gay person in the Trump administration, is leading the effort, which kicks off Tuesday evening in Berlin. The U.S. embassy is flying in LGBT activists from across Europe for a strategy dinner to plan to push for decriminalization in places that still outlaw homosexuality — mostly concentrated in the Middle East, Africa and the Caribbean.

“It is concerning that, in the 21st century, some 70 countries continue to have laws that criminalize LGBTI status or conduct,” said a U.S. official involved in organizing the event."

"Anxiety. Depression. Stress. These are some of the emotions LGBTQ Americans experienced during the Trump administration, according to two recent studies. The reports, conducted independently, both landed on the same conclusion: There was a significant decline in the mental well-being of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people while Donald Trump was president. 
[...]
Even before Trump's election, LGBTQ advocates sounded the alarm about his track record and that of his running mate, Mike Pence, who publicly opposed same-sex marriage and other LGBTQ rights. Once sworn in, the Trump administration took numerous steps to roll back LGBTQ rights and protections, including banning transgender people from the military, withdrawing Title IX protections for transgender students and reversing plans to count LGBTQ people on the census."

"Donald Trump has appointed Richard Grenell to be the new acting director of national intelligence. Mr Grenell, formerly the US ambassador to Germany, is believed to be the first openly gay cabinet member.

Mr Grenell replaces former US Navy admiral Joseph Maguire, who has been acting director since Dan Coats stepped down from the role in August."

"In other words, according to the women, Trump — who claimed he had never actually done what he'd said he had on the 2005 tape — was telling the truth when he described how approached women.

It's all part of a bigger pattern for the Republican nominee, who has been objectifying and dehumanizing women goes back decades. Before the new revelations, he had twice been accused of sexual assault. Trump’s misogyny has been in plain sight for a long time.

In public and private, he’s made clear that women matter to him not as people but as sex objects. Even with women whom he supposedly likes and admires, he’s made clear that he values their looks above all else."

"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump found himself in hot water on Friday, after a 2005 hot mic video surfaced, giving viewers (and voters) a first person look into the mind of a younger Mr. Trump.

It wasn’t pretty – the video caught Trump referring to engaging in vulgar and non-consensual sexual acts with “beautiful women,” despite his recent marriage to current wife Melania Trump. After hours of public outcry, Trump finally issued an apology late Friday night."

"The president has faced criticism for the way he refers to his child’s looks – reportedly telling a Miss Universe winner in 1997, when Ivanka was 16, “Don’t you think my daughter’s hot? She’s hot, right?”.

Speaking to Rolling Stone in 2015, he said of her: “She's really something, and what a beauty, that one. If I weren't happily married and, ya know, her father...’”"

"In interviews last week, she said she intended to act as a moderating force in an administration swept into office by nationalist sentiment. Other officials added that she had weighed in on topics including climate, deportation, education and refugee policy.

Ms. Trump, 35, a former model, entrepreneur and hotel developer, says she will focus on gender inequality in the United States and abroad, by aiming to create a federal paid leave program, more affordable child care and a global fund for women who are entrepreneurs, among other efforts. Her interest in gender issues grew out of a “Women Who Work” hashtag and marketing campaign she devised a few years ago to help sell $99 pumps and $150 dresses. On Tuesday, the career advice book she worked on before the election, whose title echoes her hashtag, was released."

"There have never been more Black and Hispanic Americans in the workforce, Friday’s Labor Department job report showed.

The jobless rate for Hispanics hit a record low of 3.9% in September, while African Americans maintained its lowest rate ever, 5.5%."
[852] https://www.newsweek.com/trump-female-employment-sorry-women-i-let-you-down-again-1098500
"President Donald J. Trump’s agenda is driving an economic resurgence that is creating more and more employment opportunities for American workers.
[...]
Women’s unemployment recently reached its lowest rate in 65 years."
[853] https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osec/osec20181005
"Encouraging indicators were broad based. For the fifth month this year, the unemployment rate has been below 4.0%. The unemployment rate for women fell to 3.6%, the lowest in 65 years, and the unemployment rate for Hispanics matched a record low set in July 2018. The number of unemployed fell below six million for the first time since December 2000."
[854] https://www.factcheck.org/2018/01/misleading-talking-point-women-workers/
"President Donald Trump and White House counselor Kellyanne Conway have been boasting lately about the increase in the number of women employees on the president’s watch as a sign of economic progress. But this is a misleading talking point.

It’s true that 863,000 women joined the workforce during the president’s first 11 months in office, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But that’s 34 percent less than the number of women workers that were added over the same period, from January to December, in each of the last two years.

In fact, it’s the smallest increase since 2012 and below the historical norm for the past 54 years, dating to 1964."

"But retired NASA astronaut Mark Kelly — a former Navy pilot, combat veteran, four-time space-flyer, and the identical twin brother of the former astronaut Scott Kelly — doesn't support the plan, and some members of Congress have also voiced their distaste for the idea.

"This is a dumb idea. The Air Force does this already. That is their job," Mark Kelly tweeted in June, following Trump's remarks. "What's next, we move submarines to the 7th branch and call it the 'under-the-sea force?'"

[...]

Kelly was referring to the Air Force Space Command, though the group has had different names over the years.

Space Command is headquartered in Colorado, and its responsibilities include supporting military use of satellites, rocket launches, and cyberwarfare operations. The group also helps track the countless pieces of space junk and debris around Earth that pose a persistent threat to anything in orbit."

"WASHINGTON, D.C. -- As President Donald Trump prepares to leave the White House, 34% of Americans approve of the job he is doing as president, the worst evaluation of his presidency. His 41% average approval rating throughout his presidency is four points lower than for any of his predecessors in Gallup's polling era. Trump's ratings showed a record 81-percentage-point average gap between Republicans and Democrats -- 11 points wider than the prior record."

[977] https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/evidence-unpopular-mr-lincoln
"At the time he was sworn in, Lincoln's "approval rating" can be estimated by examining wintertime Republican losses in local elections in Brooklyn, Cincinnati, Cleveland and St. Louis, and state elections in Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island; by the observations of Henry Adams (of the presidential Adamses) that "not a third of the House" supported him; and by the published reckoning of the New York Herald that only 1 million of the 4.7 million who voted in November were still with him. All these indications put his support in the nation at about 25 percent — roughly equivalent to the lowest approval ratings recorded by modern-day polling."
[978] https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/who-was-worst-president-everand-how-do-historians-decide-180978105/
"By comparison, Buchanan’s successor, Abraham Lincoln, maintained his tight grip on the top spot for leading the nation through the Civil War and abolishing slavery. He’s the standalone figure in a string of worst-ranked presidents that stretches from 1837 to 1869, notes the Post.

In general, time tends to be on the side of presidents like Ronald Reagan and Dwight Eisenhower, who were unpopular with historians at the time of leaving office but are highly ranked on 2021’s survey, as participant and Lyndon Johnson historian Mark K. Updegrove points out in a New York Times op-ed. With regards to recent presidents, George W. Bush debuted at 36th place in 2009 but jumped 7 places this year to spot 29; and Barack Obama rose two spots to break into the top 10 presidents this year."

Wait, there’s more. The full tweet reads: “@ariannahuff is unattractive both inside and out. I fully understand why her former husband left her for a man- he made a good decision.”

He then posted this bitterly ominous message: “Don’t think my statement on @ariannahuff was harsh, if you knew her and the phony Huffington Post you would understand— more to follow.”"

The first is a disjunction betweenthe standard accounts of democratic repre-sentation, focused primarily on territoriallybased electoral representation, and an increas-ingly complex political terrain, which is lessconfined within state territoriality, more plu-ralized, and increasingly dependent on infor-mal negotiation and deliberation to generatepolitical legitimacy."

"Due to their role as intermediaries between the political system and the public, media organizations and journalists who produce and relay content to citizens play a major role
in current democracies. They fulfil an important double-function in a democracy by informing the public of political processes and reflecting the public opinion for the political elites. It has been argued that any deliberate use of the media as an instrument to manipulate public opinion or political processes would pose a strong
challenge to any modern democracy."

"Antifa is short for "anti-fascist." It is a loosely organized coalition of protesters, left-wing activists, and self-described anarchists who vow to physically confront "fascists" — meaning anyone who espouses bigoted or totalitarian views.

Dana R. Fisher, a sociologist who has studied protest movements in the United States for decades, said she's come to view Antifa protesters as a militant response to the rise in visibility of white nationalist organizations since Trump's election.
[...]
Antifa protesters often use a tactic called "black bloc," a style of protesting popularized by anti-government demonstrators in Europe. They typically wear all black clothing and hide their faces to avoid being identified by police, to avoid being pepper sprayed and also to cast an intimidating presence.

In both the U.S. and Europe, the "black bloc" tactics generally include rioting, vandalism and protesting without a permit."

"President Trump attacked Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the Justice Department on Monday in connection with the indictments of two GOP congressmen on corruption charges, saying they could hurt the Republican Party in the midterm elections.

“Two long running, Obama era, investigations of two very popular Republican Congressmen were brought to a well publicized charge, just ahead of the Mid-Terms, by the Jeff Sessions Justice Department,” he said on Twitter. “Two easy wins now in doubt because there is not enough time.”"

Giuliani told The New Yorker that it’s likely the Trump administration would object to the memo being made public information. 

[...] “I’m sure we will,” he said, before adding that Trump would make the final call on a decision like that. 

Giuliani made the comments in reference to the impending report that Mueller will file to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein at the conclusion of his investigation into Russian election interference."

"An appeals court in San Francisco will hear arguments Wednesday in former Sheriff Joe Arpaio's bid to erase his contempt of court conviction from his record after he was pardoned by President Donald Trump.

The former six-term sheriff of metro Phoenix had appealed a lower-court ruling that refused to expunge his conviction for disobeying a 2011 court order barring his traffic patrols that targeted immigrants."

""Lock her up!" the crowd at President Donald Trump's campaign rally in Toledo, Ohio, on Thursday night chanted. "You should lock her up, I'll tell you," Trump agreed.
The "her" is Hillary Clinton. The crime for which the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee should allegedly be imprisoned isn't clear. But the chant has become a regular part of the circus-like atmosphere at Trump rallies, a sort of calling card for the movement."

"After this, we’re going to walk down — and I’ll be there with you — we’re going to walk down, we’re going to walk down — anyone you want, but I think right here — we’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women. And we’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them. Because you’ll never take back our country with weakness, you have to show strength, and you have to be strong. We have come to demand that Congress do the right thing, and only count the electors who have been lawfully slated — lawfully slated. I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard today."

"Yet when you look for recorded details of Trump’s 2.26pm call which was made, as Hugo Lowell of the Guardian revealed, on an official White House landline, they are nowhere to be found. The Lee call was one of an unknown number that Trump made during a mysterious gap of 7 hours 37 minutes that exists in the call logs – precisely the timeframe of the Capitol attack.

Those missing call logs, disclosed by the Washington Post and CBS News, raise several burning questions – how did the records disappear? who carried out the excising? – but none more urgent than this: what was Trump trying to hide?

“A gap like this doesn’t happen by accident. It’s not a coincidence,” said Charlie Sykes, columnist at the Trump-resistant conservative outlet the Bulwark. “There is no innocent explanation here – somebody made the decision to rip up the record for the crucial hours of January 6 and there has to be a reason why.”"
